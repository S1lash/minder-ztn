# Contributing

Engine improvements — skills, slash commands, scripts, system docs —
are welcome. Personal data layers are not.

## What is "engine"

`.engine-manifest.yml` at the repo root is the source of truth. The
`engine:` and `template:` sections list every path that ships from the
upstream skeleton to friend clones. Anything outside those sections is
your own data and stays in your repo.

Engine paths in short:

- `integrations/claude-code/{rules,commands,skills}/` — Claude Code
  prompts and skills.
- `integrations/minder-ztn-mcp/` — MCP integration guide.
- `integrations/obsidian/` — Obsidian vault config seed (`.obsidian/`
  defaults + `minder-ztn.md` dashboard). Idempotent seeder runs from
  `claude-code/install.sh`; never overwrites a friend's live `.obsidian/`.
- `scripts/` — release, sync, gates, migrations; `scripts/lib/` holds
  the primitives they share.
- `zettelkasten/_system/{docs,scripts}` and the pure-spec registries
  `registries/{FOLDERS,CONCEPT_NAMING,CONCEPT_TYPES,AGENT_LENSES}.md`
  + `registries/lenses/` — authoritative system spec. CONCEPT_NAMING
  and AUDIENCES define the autonomous resolution contract for the
  concept and audience layers (engine resolves format issues
  mechanically — never raises a CLARIFICATION for owner action; see
  ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.1 layer-specific exception).
- `zettelkasten/_system/registries/{AUDIENCES,DOMAINS}.template.md` —
  seeds for the `audience_tags` whitelist and the domain vocabulary.
  They ship as templates, not engine, because each file carries an
  owner-mutable Extensions table beside its spec; the live
  `AUDIENCES.md` / `DOMAINS.md` are owner data after install.
- `zettelkasten/_system/roles/{_run-frame,_minder}.md` — the two engine
  files every role's prompt is assembled from. Everything else under
  `_system/roles/` is owner data.
- `zettelkasten/5_meta/{CONCEPT.md,PROCESSING_PRINCIPLES.md,templates/,starter-pack/}`
- `zettelkasten/5_skills/` — quick-reference cards.
- `zettelkasten/0_constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` — protocol spec
  (your `axiom/principle/rule/` files stay yours).
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json` — project-local
  engine-development guide and permissive Bash allowlist for common
  dev/CI commands.
- `.claude/skills/` — the canonical skill-discovery tree (symlinks
  here, dereferenced into real files on release) and
  `.claude/agents/ztn-role.md`, the subagent the roles tick spawns.
- `docs/{onboarding,upstream-sync,scheduling,obsidian,privacy,CHANGELOG}.md`
  — the friend-facing docs.
- `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (forces LF — a CRLF checkout breaks
  bash and python on Windows), `LICENSE`, `integrations/VERSION`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Notably **not** engine: `.github/workflows/` is owner-only CI (a
friend's clone stays CI-free by design — engine quality is upstream's
concern), and the repo root `README.md` is the maintainer's own; the
public one ships from `README.template.md`.

Before opening an engine PR, read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — it codifies
the boundary between engine paths and owner-data paths, the
documentation conventions enforced on every doc edit, and the
verification commands (linter, pytest, release dry-run) that gate
engine changes.

## Workflow

1. Fork the upstream skeleton (the public `minder-ztn` repo).
2. Branch off `main` (`feat/<short-slug>` or `fix/<short-slug>`).
3. Make engine changes only — never touch a path outside the manifest.
   A `template:` path is edited **only** for its spec portion (a
   canonical set, a format rule, an example value), never for the
   owner-mutable rows beside it; when a template has a live sibling in
   this repo, both move in the same change or neither does.
4. Run the three gates before opening a PR. CI runs all three, and
   `release_engine.py` runs all three again at release time — the first
   two before it copies anything, the seed-contract gate against the
   assembled skeleton afterwards:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check_portability.py      # ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.9
   python3 scripts/check_no_personal_data.py # no owner identity in engine code
   python3 scripts/check_seed_contract.py    # template / seed declarations
   ```

   The portability gate is the one most likely to stop you, and it is the
   one worth reading the output of: it names the construct, why it breaks,
   and what to write instead. Every rule it enforces already existed in
   `ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.9` — the gate only makes it executable, because a
   rule enforced by memory alone reaches a friend's Windows machine broken.
5. Bump `integrations/VERSION` (semver). Add a migration under
   `scripts/migrations/NNN-short-slug.sh` if your change is
   breaking — see `scripts/migrations/README.md`, and declare its
   `# migration-kind:` (`structural` or `heal`) in the header.
6. Open a pull request describing the user-visible behaviour change
   and the migration story.

## Style

- Engine docs follow `_system/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — describe current
  behaviour, no version refs / phase narratives / rename history.
- Engine prompts never hardcode a person's name. When personal
  attribution is needed, read `_system/SOUL.md` `## Identity` `Name:`
  at runtime.
- Tests live under `zettelkasten/_system/scripts/tests/` (pytest).

## What does NOT belong upstream

- Anyone's `_records/`, `_sources/`, PARA notes, constitution
  principles, SOUL/PEOPLE/PROJECTS/TAGS values.
- Examples that name a real person. Use `john-doe` / `ivan-petrov`
  placeholders.
- Personal `~/.claude/` rules or memory files.
- Your migration ledger (`.engine-migrations.jsonl`, and the older flat
  `.engine-migrations-applied` if your clone still carries one).

## Release process (maintainer)

The upstream maintainer authors engine changes in their personal
instance, then runs `scripts/release_engine.py --target <skeleton-tree>`
to publish to the public skeleton. Friends pick up the change via
`/ztn:update` (interactive Claude skill — default) or
`scripts/sync_engine.sh` (non-interactive shell, CI / power users).
