# Ensure project-level ZTN skills resolve at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
#
# Skill discovery for Cloud Routines and project-CWD sessions depends on
# `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` being a READABLE file in the clone. The
# owner's repo keeps these as symlinks into `integrations/claude-code/skills/`
# (native on macOS / Linux, convenient for the dev loop); the public skeleton
# ships them as real files, because git symlinks do NOT survive a Windows
# clone — with `core.symlinks=false` git materialises the symlink blob as a
# text file containing the target path, so `.claude/skills/ztn-process` becomes
# a FILE (not a directory) and `.claude/skills/ztn-process/SKILL.md` no longer
# exists. The runtime then cannot load the skill and every `/ztn:*` slash
# invocation in a scheduler tick fails at the first step.
#
# The canonical set of skills is the directory listing under
# `integrations/claude-code/skills/` — the single source of truth. This
# helper reconciles `.claude/skills/` against it.
#
# Modes:
#   (default) check-only — verify every skill resolves. Exit 0 if all do,
#     3 if any are missing/broken (broken names printed to stderr). Never
#     mutates the working tree.
#   --repair — additionally recreate any missing/broken entry. Prefers a
#     relative symlink (`ln -sfn`); if the filesystem or git refuses
#     symlinks (Windows without developer mode), falls back to copying the
#     skill directory as real files. Idempotent — good entries are left
#     untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/scheduler/ensure-skills.sh            # check only
#   bash scripts/scheduler/ensure-skills.sh --repair   # heal broken entries
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all skills resolve (after optional repair)
#   2 — --repair could not fix an entry (source missing / write failed)
#   3 — check-only found broken skills (no --repair requested)
