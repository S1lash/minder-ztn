"""Record one tick's own token consumption, read from its own transcript.

Claude Code writes every API response it receives to a session transcript —
`{projects_root}/{cwd-slug}/{session-id}.jsonl` — with the response's `usage`
block intact, and gives each sub-agent its own file under
`{session-id}/subagents/`. Both exist in a cloud Routines sandbox exactly as
they do locally, and both are written as the run proceeds. So a tick can
measure itself while it is still running, from data the runtime produced
rather than from anything the model believes about itself.

That distinction is the whole point. A model cannot see its own consumption:
the only figure in its context is the remaining budget counter, which knows
nothing about cache reads, nothing about sub-agents, and is not what anyone
means by "what did this tick cost". Any self-reported number would be
invention. This reads the file instead.

**Ticks only.** The scheduler prompts call this; a manual `/ztn:process` run
does not, and is not expected to. Nothing here detects or complains about an
un-measured manual run — the tick is the unit being measured, and the lint
backstop scopes itself to `[scheduled]` commits for the same reason.

**Never fails the tick.** Every failure path still writes a line and exits 0.
A tick that dies because its own instrumentation could not find a file would
be a strictly worse system than one with no instrumentation at all, so the
absent measurement is recorded as `status: unmeasured` with the reason, and
the tick proceeds. That also keeps "the measurement broke" distinguishable
from "the tick never ran", which are different failures with different fixes.

**What it cannot see.** Its own final messages: this runs before
`finalize-tick.sh`, so the commit and the closing report are not in the file
yet, and a second commit to add them is forbidden by the single-commit
guarantee. `measured_through` marks the horizon, and the undercount is a
handful of messages out of dozens.
