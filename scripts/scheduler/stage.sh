# Stage owner-data changes for the current scheduler tick — DOES NOT commit
# or push. The single point that produces a commit is finalize-tick.sh, run
# once at the tail of the scheduler prompt.
#
# Engine paths are NEVER staged. The engine boundary is derived from
# `.engine-manifest.yml` (single source of truth) via the companion helper
# `_classify_paths.py`. If dirty engine paths are detected, an explanatory
# note is appended to CLARIFICATIONS.md (which is itself owner data and
# gets staged) and engine paths are left dirty in the working tree.
#
# A tick may additionally HOLD BACK owner-data paths it has deliberately
# left dirty, by writing them one per line (UTF-8, LF, repo-relative) to
# `.scheduler-state/hold-back` before calling this script. A held-back path
# is skipped and noted the same way engine drift is. Two cases it exists for,
# both from `/ztn:roles`, both the same shape — a path the guard deliberately
# left dirty, against a script whose default is to stage every dirty owner
# path:
#   1. a file a role wrote a credential into that the guard could not restore
#      — committing it would put a live secret in history;
#   2. anything a role wrote outside its zone when the check ABORTED
#      (`git_surface` / `unsettled` / `head_moved`), because an abort mutates
#      nothing by design — so without the list, the tick's refusal to touch
#      those paths would end with this script committing and pushing them.
# A hold-back list is consumed once, then removed, so it can never silently
# suppress a later tick's staging.
#
# Idempotent: re-running with no new changes is a no-op. Safe to call
# multiple times within a tick — finalize-tick.sh collapses everything
# into one commit regardless.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/scheduler/stage.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — staged (or nothing to stage)
#   2 — git operation failed (see stderr)
