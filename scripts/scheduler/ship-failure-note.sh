#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Append a one-line failure note to CLARIFICATIONS.md and ship it via
# scripts/scheduler/finalize-tick.sh so the owner sees what went wrong on
# the next interactive resolve session.
#
# Idempotent: ensures the `### Scheduler failures` section exists before
# appending. printf uses `--` end-of-options guard because the appended
# bullet starts with `-` (a leading dash is otherwise parsed as a flag —
# observed failure 2026-05-07T01:06Z).
#
# Local-only fallback. If finalize-tick.sh refuses to commit (e.g. owner
# has non-scheduled commits ahead of origin/main blocking the fold path),
# the note would otherwise vanish into the dirty working tree and remain
# invisible for weeks. To prevent silent note loss, this script falls back
# to a LOCAL commit (no push) tagged `scheduler/failure-local`. The note
# lands in local history; the owner picks it up on their next interactive
# session and `/ztn:save` ships it then. Local fallback never force-pushes
# and never amends history.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/scheduler/ship-failure-note.sh "<cause>" <tick-name>
#
# Example:
#   bash scripts/scheduler/ship-failure-note.sh \
#     "lock-check failed: .lint.lock recent" lint-nightly
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — note appended and shipped (or appended locally as fallback)
#   1 — bad invocation
#   2 — note appended but neither remote nor local commit succeeded
#       (CLARIFICATIONS edit remains in dirty working tree — surfaced to
#       stderr so the parent prompt sees the failure)
