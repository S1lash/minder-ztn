# Check the cross-skill pipeline locks before a scheduler tick acquires
# its own lock via the skill body. Stale locks (>2h) are removed; recent
# locks abort the tick.

# Lock matrix mirrored from zettelkasten/_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md
# §«Cross-skill lock contract». All pipeline locks live under
# `_sources/.{name}.lock` (the inbox dir doubles as the lock home for
# every pipeline skill — process / maintain / lint / agent-lens / content /
# roles — plus the resolve session). Each skill reads them all at Step 0 and aborts
# on any present. `.content.lock` matters because `/ztn:content --maintain`
# reads CONTENT_MAP.md while `/ztn:maintain` (Step 7.8) rewrites it.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/scheduler/lock-check.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no recent lock found (safe to proceed)
#   1 — at least one lock is recent; lock names printed to stderr

# The base name is the owner's choice, not a constant — `roles_config`
# discovers it precisely because of that. Deriving it here too is what keeps
# this script from reporting "clear" while a lock sits in a renamed base.
