# Ensure the roles tick can open an encrypted credential store.
#
# The store (`_system/state/secrets.enc.json`) is encrypted with `cryptography`,
# which the engine imports LAZILY: a base with no credentials never needs the
# package and must not be made to care about it. A base WITH credentials cannot
# open the store without it, and every role that declares one then fails.
#
# Why this helper exists rather than a line in the docs telling the owner to
# install it: a Cloud Routines sandbox starts from a fresh clone every run, so
# nothing an owner installs there persists to the next tick. «Install it where
# the tick runs» is unactionable advice in exactly the environment that made the
# store encrypted-and-committed in the first place. Without this, a credentialed
# role works on a laptop and is dead on arrival in the cloud.
#
# It is deliberately narrow:
#   - does NOTHING when the base has no store — the common case pays nothing,
#     and a base without credentials never installs a package it will not use;
#   - does NOTHING when the import already works — an idempotent no-op, so a
#     sandbox that ships the package costs one interpreter start;
#   - installs ONLY when a store exists AND the import fails, and only a
#     VALIDATED spec for the one package the engine declares;
#   - never touches the store, never reads a credential, never prints one, and
#     never sees the key — it only proves the package imports.
#
# A failed install is not fatal here. The tick's own `secrets-open` reports the
# condition through the ordinary `role-secrets-unavailable` path, which names
# the cause and degrades instead of dying: roles needing no credential still
# run. This helper's job is to remove the failure when it can, not to become a
# second place that decides what happens when it cannot.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/scheduler/ensure-roles-deps.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — nothing needed, or the package is importable (before or after install)
#   2 — more than one ZTN base in the repository (which one is meant?)
#       (no base at all is exit 0 — a repo without one has nothing to check)
#   3 — a store exists and the package is still unimportable; the tick will
#       degrade and say so. Advisory: the caller does NOT abort on this.

# no whitespace, no shell metacharacter. Anything else falls back to the bare
# name, which pip resolves from the configured index.
