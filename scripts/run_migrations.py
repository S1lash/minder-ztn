"""Run pending engine migrations, honouring each one's declared kind.

The runner half of the migration contract; the ledger half is
`scripts/lib/migrations.py`, which explains why a kind exists at all. In short:
a best-effort repair of historical data must never be able to block a future
engine update, and under the previous bash loop it could — permanently.

Behaviour:

  * `structural` failure — abort immediately, record nothing. The migration
    re-runs on the next update, exactly as before. Exit 1.
  * `heal` failure — record `partial`, print the failure, keep going. The
    migration is retried next update, so an improved repair shipped later
    reaches the clone by itself. Exit 0 overall.
  * success — record `applied`; never runs again.

Lives in python rather than in `sync_engine.sh` for two reasons: the logic is
identical on every platform without a single bash-3.2 or Git-Bash caveat, and
it is testable. `sync_engine.sh` and the `/ztn:update` skill both call this one
entrypoint, so there is a single owner of "what has run here".

Usage:
  python3 scripts/run_migrations.py                 # run everything pending
  python3 scripts/run_migrations.py --dry-run       # list pending + kinds
  python3 scripts/run_migrations.py --json          # machine-readable result
