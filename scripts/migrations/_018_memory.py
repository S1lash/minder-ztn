"""What a previous-shape role accumulated between runs, and where it lives.

Shared by `_018_handoff.py` (which tells the owner) and `_018_plan.py` (which
tells the concierge). One reader, so the two can never disagree about what a
role holds.

WHY THIS EXISTS

A role's assignment is what the owner asked for; its state is what the role
learnt. For a role that ran for months, the second is the larger half — a board
of work in flight, a reading of where the project stands, a health verdict per
item, a log of what it decided and why. The previous shape kept it in
`state.md` (a readable projection), `parts/*.json` (the data behind it) and
`decisions.jsonl` (the log).

Without this module the hand-off named those files only as proof that the role
had run, and the conversion plan did not mention them at all. Every byte
survived the move and nothing pointed at it, so the owner re-created the role
from its assignment alone and it woke up with no memory of anything. Data that
is present but unreferenced is lost in every way that matters to the person who
needs it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

It does not copy the content into the plan. The files are the source of truth
and they sit beside it; a second copy would drift from them the moment the
owner edits either, and a ledger has no bound on its size. This reports what is
there, how much of it, and where — precisely enough that neither the owner nor
the concierge can walk past it.

Every path it emits is relative to the parked directory. That is the right base
for the plan, which sits there — and the wrong one for the hand-off, which is
read from the repository root. So the ONE conversion between them lives here as
`repo_path()`, and no caller builds a prefix of its own. A path with two owners
is how the hand-off came to carry `_previous/x/state.md` one line below
`<base>/_system/roles/_previous/x/`: both were plausible, neither resolved, and
each looked right beside the code that wrote it.
