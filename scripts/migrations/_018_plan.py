"""Turn a previous-shape role directory into a conversion PLAN the concierge runs.

The hand-off tells the owner what they had. This tells `/ztn:role:add` what it
can carry across without asking, and — just as importantly — what it must not
decide alone. One JSON file per migration, read by `/ztn:role:add --from-previous`.

Why a plan rather than a finished role: the previous shape's prose is written in
a vocabulary that no longer exists (parts, ledger ops, staged acts), and copying
it verbatim would tell a role to do things nothing implements — it would not
fail, it would improvise. Rewriting that prose into the current vocabulary is
exactly what the concierge is for. And `writes:` is the boundary the whole design
rests on: the plan PROPOSES it, with its reasoning, and the owner confirms. A
proposal the owner sees is not a guess.

What is derivable, and how confident:

    certain   — id, name, cadence, status. Same meaning in both shapes.
    proposed  — writes. `emit_inbox: true` means the role put notes in the
                inbox; any role keeps its own state. Both are safe defaults the
                owner confirms. Anything beyond them is theirs to name.
    proposed  — secrets, and ONLY for a role that actually reached outward.
                The store's names belong to the base, not to any one role. The
                store is the SAME file and the SAME encryption in both shapes —
                only the env var holding the key was renamed — so the values
                carry across intact and nothing is re-entered.
    seed      — the body. The old `hooks/tick.md`, handed to the concierge as
                RAW MATERIAL to rewrite, never as text to paste.
    memory    — what the role LEARNT, as an inventory with paths. The
                assignment is half a long-running role; the other half is the
                board, the reading and the verdicts it built up over months.
                Both shapes keep that between runs, so it carries across — but
                only if something points at it. Nothing did, and a re-created
                role woke up remembering nothing while every byte sat intact
                one directory away.

Emits `_previous/{id}.plan.json`. Deletes nothing, reads only.

**The plan file is a view, not the source.** What a parked role holds lives in
the parked directory; this only reads it. So the file may be regenerated at any
time, and `/ztn:role:add --from-previous` does exactly that before reading it:

    python3 scripts/migrations/_018_plan.py <base>/_system/roles/_previous

Deriving at read time is what removes the whole «this artifact was written
before we knew better» class, rather than one instance of it. A migration
records itself applied and never runs again, so a plan written by an older
engine would otherwise stay on disk, authoritative and wrong, forever.

Invoked with the parked directory alone, it reads the credential store's names
itself. That derivation used to live in the calling shell, which made two owners
for one fact.
