"""Strict self-check for the previous-shape role migration.

Run at the end of migration 018, and re-runnable by the owner at any time:

    python3 scripts/migrations/_018_selfcheck.py [<base>]

It answers one question — **is the owner's data still whole, and is the state
of play what the migration says it is?** — and it answers it by looking, not by
trusting what the migration reported.

The bar is deliberately harsh in one direction: every check that cannot prove
its claim FAILS. A migration that quietly half-worked is worse than one that
refused, because the owner stops looking.

Exit codes:
    0 — every check passed
    1 — at least one check FAILED (owner data at risk, or a false claim)
    2 — the check could not run (no base, unreadable tree)
