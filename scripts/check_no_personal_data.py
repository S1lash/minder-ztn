"""
Personal-data linter.

Reads `.engine-manifest.yml` to learn which paths are engine + template
(those must contain no personal data identifying the owner of this
specific instance). Greps each path for blacklist patterns and reports.

The blacklist itself ships EMPTY in this script (see `DEFAULT_BLACKLIST`
below) — this script is engine code and reaches every friend's clone.
Three layers feed the final pattern list, in order:

1. `DEFAULT_BLACKLIST` — always empty (see above).
2. `load_owner_blacklist` — this instance's hand-curated residue list,
   read from `<repo-root>/personal-data-blacklist.txt` (git-tracked here,
   never shipped — see below).
3. `build_dynamic_blacklist` — patterns DERIVED at scan time from this
   instance's own data registries: `zettelkasten/3_resources/people/PEOPLE.md`
   (every real person's id + name), `zettelkasten/1_projects/PROJECTS.md`
   (every real project's id + display name), `zettelkasten/_system/SOUL.md`
   (the owner's Identity section — name, employer, location, handle, email),
   and `zettelkasten/0_constitution/{axiom,principle,rule}/*.md` (every
   principle's verbatim title + statement, ≥20 chars). This is what makes
   the linter auto-cover a growing PEOPLE.md/PROJECTS.md without hand-
   maintaining a blacklist line per person — a static list proved
   insufficient in practice (real coworker names, project names, and a
   verbatim axiom quote slipped through it before this layer existed).
   Guarded by `SAFE_TERMS` (synthetic placeholders and public product
   names like `Minder`/`ZTN` are never turned into patterns, even though
   they appear literally in the registries as example rows or project
   names), a common-word stoplist, a minimum length, and a placeholder
   (`{...}`) skip — see `_finalize_pattern` and the source-specific
   extractors below it for the full guard chain. On a fresh clone the
   registries are still template-shaped, so this layer returns close to
   nothing and the linter still runs clean.

The constitution-derived slice of the dynamic layer (verbatim axiom/
principle/rule title + statement patterns) is further scoped by
`SANCTIONED_PRINCIPLE_HOMES`: a small set of paths that legitimately ship
verbatim owner axioms as worked examples (the onboarding starter-pack, the
constitution protocol spec's own example, and the pipeline test fixtures).
`build_dynamic_blacklist_tagged` returns the constitution patterns as a
separate tagged list; `main()` skips that list — and only that list — when
scanning a file under one of those paths. Every other pattern class (people,
projects, identity, static blacklist) still applies there, and the
constitution patterns still apply to every other file. See
`SANCTIONED_PRINCIPLE_HOMES` below for the exact path list and rationale.

This instance's real patterns live in `<repo-root>/personal-data-blacklist.txt`,
a git-tracked-but-never-shipped file read at runtime (see
`load_owner_blacklist`). Friends populate their own from
`personal-data-blacklist.example.txt` (which does ship); the dynamic layer
above works for them too, with zero setup, once their own registries fill in.

Exit code:
  0 — no leaks found
  1 — leaks found (CI fails)

#
# The dynamic layer above derives patterns from the instance's REGISTRIES and
# greps shipped files for them. It structurally cannot reach one class: the
# owner's own words, quoted out of a transcript and left in a shipped prompt as
# a worked example. The corpus (`_records/`, `_sources/`) is free prose with no
# bounded pattern to extract — any extraction wide enough to catch such a
# sentence flags ordinary language.
#
# So this layer searches the other way. Spans a shipped file DELIMITS as a
# quotation are few (hundreds) and are by construction intended examples; each
# is tested for exact occurrence in the corpus. Exact match keeps the verdict
# deterministic and the false-positive rate near zero: a sentence the engine
# invented does not appear verbatim in a transcript.
#
# Known limitation, stated rather than papered over: only DELIMITED spans are
# checked. A verbatim owner sentence written into a prompt with no quotation
# marks escapes this layer. Widening to undelimited n-grams was considered and
# rejected — the cost is a false-positive tail that needs a stoplist, and every
# example these prompts actually contain is delimited.
#
# Output discipline (load-bearing): a hit prints the SHIPPED file, its line,
# the span — all three already committed in git — plus the corpus file's PATH.
# Never corpus surrounding text. A gate against leaking the owner's words must
# not leak them into a terminal or a CI log while reporting.
