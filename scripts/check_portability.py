"""Portability gate — makes `ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.9` executable.

§3.9 requires every shipped artefact to behave identically on Windows (Git
Bash), macOS (system **bash 3.2**) and Linux. Until this gate existed the rule
was enforced by human memory, and memory does not scale: a friend's Windows
clone was found running an engine update that silently applied nothing, an
installer that aborted halfway leaving residue, and a release gate that could
not start at all — every one of them a violation of a rule already written down.

What it does. For every file the manifest actually ships (`engine:` +
`template:`, minus `exclude:`), it looks for the specific constructs §3.9
forbids and reports each with the reason and the correct replacement.

Where it looks. Rules match against **code**, never prose: shell `#` comments,
python `#` comments and python docstrings are blanked before matching, and
markdown is scanned inside fenced code blocks only. A doc that *describes* a
banned construct — which the doctrine and the contributor guide both do,
deliberately — is therefore never a finding.

Two escapes, both loud, never silent:

  * an inline `portability-ok: <reason>` comment on the offending line or the
    line directly above it;
  * a row in `scripts/portability-allowlist.txt` — `path<TAB>rule<TAB>reason`,
    the reason column mandatory.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check_portability.py              # enforce: exit 1 on any finding
  python3 scripts/check_portability.py --report     # list findings, exit 0
  python3 scripts/check_portability.py --rules      # describe every rule
  python3 scripts/check_portability.py --path X     # scan one path (repo-relative)

Run by CI and by `release_engine.py`, alongside the personal-data gate. A
release cannot ship a §3.9 violation.
