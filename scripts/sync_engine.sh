# Sync engine paths from upstream/main into this clone.
#
# For friends (and the personal instance) — pulls engine updates that
# the upstream maintainer has shipped, without touching local data
# (records, knowledge, registries, constitution principles, SOUL, etc).
#
# Reads .engine-manifest.yml. For each `engine:` path, fetches the
# upstream version and overwrites the local path. `template:` paths are
# DELIBERATELY skipped — they seed once at clone time and are then
# friend's data. Then two steps that a plain copy cannot express:
# `retire_paths.py` removes what the manifest lists as `retired:` (a sync
# copies what upstream HAS, never what it no longer has), and
# `run_migrations.py` runs the pending chain, honouring each migration's
# declared kind.
#
# This script is the CI / power-user entry point. The default owner path is
# the `/ztn:update` skill, which does the same work with a preview and a
# plain-language digest — and which repairs THIS script from upstream before
# reading it, so a clone stuck on an old broken copy can always recover.
#
# Preconditions:
#   - git remote `upstream` configured and reachable
#   - working tree clean (script aborts if dirty in any engine path)
#   - python3 + PyYAML (used to parse the manifest)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync_engine.sh                # fetch + apply
#   scripts/sync_engine.sh --dry-run      # show what would change
#   scripts/sync_engine.sh --remote name  # use a remote other than upstream
#   scripts/sync_engine.sh --self-heal    # repair THIS script from the remote
#                                         # first, then re-run — recovery for a
#                                         # clone whose copy is too broken to
