"""The single reader of `.engine-manifest.yml`.

The manifest declares what leaves this instance for the public skeleton. Four
tools need that answer — the release copier, the personal-data gate, the
seed-contract gate, the portability gate — and a fifth (the scheduler's path
classifier) needs it inside a sandbox that has no PyYAML. Before this module
each had its own reader, and they had already drifted: the personal-data gate
expanded `engine:` + `template:` but never subtracted `exclude:`, so a file the
manifest says never ships still tripped the gate.

Two readers live here, on purpose, with a test that pins them together:

- `load_manifest` — PyYAML, full document. For tooling that already depends on
  PyYAML and needs the whole structure (`seed_skill:`, `version:`).
- `read_section_lite` — dependency-free line parser for the three list-shaped
  sections. The scheduler sandbox runs `_classify_paths.py` with nothing but a
  stock python, so it cannot import PyYAML; that constraint is real and is why
  a second reader exists rather than being a DRY violation.

`test_engine_lib.py::ManifestTests::test_lite_matches_yaml_on_every_list_section`
asserts the two agree on every section of the live manifest, so they cannot
diverge silently. It has already earned its keep: it caught the lite reader
keeping an inline `# comment` that YAML strips.
