"""The migration ledger — what ran, and with what outcome.

Why a ledger and not a name list. `sync_engine.sh` used to run each migration
with `bash "$m"` under `set -euo pipefail` and append its name to a flat
`.engine-migrations-applied` file *after* the call. A non-zero exit therefore
aborted the whole update AND left the name unrecorded — so every future
`/ztn:update` re-ran the same migration and re-aborted at the same point. A
friend's clone was stuck that way for weeks on `007`, a best-effort repair of
historical data that can legitimately fail to fully succeed.

That inversion is the defect: a repair of old data must never be able to block
a future engine update. Fixing it needs two things this module provides.

**A declared kind.** Each migration states, in a header comment, what its
failure means:

    # migration-kind: structural   — the engine's shape is wrong without it;
                                     failure aborts the update (the old
                                     behaviour, now the explicit minority)
    # migration-kind: heal         — best-effort repair of existing data;
                                     failure is recorded and the update
                                     continues

A migration with no header is read as `structural`, so nothing silently
changes meaning.

**An outcome per attempt.** The ledger is append-only JSONL, one object per
attempt: `name`, `kind`, `rc`, `outcome`, `ts`, `note`. Outcomes:

  - `applied` — succeeded; never runs again.
  - `partial` — a `heal` that failed; the update continued, and it is retried
    on the next update. So an improved repair shipped later picks the clone up
    by itself, and a permanently-unfixable residue costs one printed line per
    update rather than a dead update channel.

A structural failure is deliberately NOT recorded: it aborts, and re-runs next
time, exactly as before.

Backward compatible: a clone carrying the old flat `.engine-migrations-applied`
file has every name in it folded into the ledger on first read, as `applied`.
Nothing is lost and no friend re-runs a migration they already have.
