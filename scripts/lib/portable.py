"""Cross-platform I/O primitives — the one place the engine gets stdout right.

Why this exists. Several engine shell scripts parse a python helper's stdout as
a newline-separated list (manifest paths, migration names, batch ids). On
Windows Git Bash, python's default text-mode stdout translates ``\\n`` to
``\\r\\n``, so every value the shell reads carries a trailing ``\\r``. The shell
then passes that literal byte to ``git``, which fails on every path — and the
script, seeing per-path failures it treats as "absent upstream", reports success
having done nothing. That is exactly the silent-no-op class this module removes:
one function, used by every producer, instead of the same three lines remembered
correctly at eight call sites.

The same applies to encoding: python on Windows defaults stdout to the ANSI code
page (cp1252), so a Cyrillic path or an em-dash raises or mojibakes on the way
out. Both are fixed together because both are properties of the same stream.

Usage — in a script whose stdout a shell reads::

    from lib.portable import emit_lines
    emit_lines(p.rstrip("/") for p in manifest["engine"])

Usage — inside a `python3 - <<'PY'` heredoc, where imports are awkward::

    import sys
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(newline="\\n", encoding="utf-8")

`configure_stdout()` is the importable form of that same call, and
`check_portability.py` accepts either as proof the heredoc is safe.

Nothing here is Windows-specific in effect: on POSIX every call is a no-op, so
there is never a reason for a caller to branch on platform.
