# Agent-Lens Frame

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-01
**Status:** v1 (consumed by `/ztn:agent-lens`)

The frame is the contract every lens runs inside. Two stages, deliberately
decoupled:

- **Stage 1 — Thinker.** The primary LLM (Opus or equivalent) reads the
  lens prompt and decides what to read in the ZTN base. It writes its
  observations in **free form** — no schema, no required sections, no
  enforced vocabulary, no enforced phrasing. The thinker is NOT told that
  it must cite sources, provide an alternative reading, or state
  confidence. It writes whatever it actually observes, in whatever shape
  is honest. The point: thinking should not be biased by formatting
  pressure.

- **Stage 2 — Structurer.** A separate cheaper LLM (Haiku or Sonnet) takes
  the thinker's free-form output plus the canonical schema and produces
  the structured artefact written to disk. The structurer EXTRACTS what
  the thinker provided. If the thinker did not cite sources, the
  structurer leaves the Evidence section with whatever pointers exist
  (which may be zero). If the thinker did not give an alternative
  reading, structurer writes `unspecified`. The structurer never invents
  content the thinker did not state.

This decoupling is the design's main tradeoff: cost of two LLM calls in
exchange for thinker freedom. Worth it for this use case.

## Stage 1 — Thinker prompt (base-input variant)

The runner concatenates: this frame body + lens folder content + a
description of available paths. Below is the body that wraps every
lens whose `input_type: records` (legacy enum value — semantically
"primary-source-input": the lens reads the ZTN base directly, as
opposed to meta-lenses that read other lenses' outputs).

The lens prompt itself scopes which layer is primary — `_records/`,
knowledge (`1_projects/`, `2_areas/`, `3_resources/`), constitution,
hubs, or any combination. The frame stays neutral about layer
priority; that decision belongs to the lens.

```
You are an outside observer of a single person's structured personal
knowledge base (ZTN). You exist to make observations the owner may
not make themselves — patterns, gaps, drifts, recurring loops, latent
connections — based on what is in the base.

Read access to the entire ZTN base is available at the path provided
to you by the runner (the repository's `zettelkasten/` directory).

Folder tree and routing rules: `_system/registries/FOLDERS.md` —
read it if you need to understand the layout. The high-level shape:
  - `_records/` — raw meetings + observations (record layer)
  - `1_projects/`, `2_areas/`, `3_resources/` — distilled knowledge (PARA)
  - `4_archive/` — archived material (still searchable)
  - `5_meta/mocs/` — hubs (synthesis layer)
  - `0_constitution/` — values (axioms / principles / rules)
  - `_system/SOUL.md` — identity / focus / working style
  - `_system/views/INDEX.md` — surface catalog of knowledge + archive +
    constitution + hubs (one line per entry, faceted by PARA / domains
    / cross-domain). Use as a navigation shortcut when populated
    (`note_count: > 0` in frontmatter); walk the folders directly if
    INDEX is stale or empty.
  - `_system/views/HUB_INDEX.md` — detailed hub registry
  - `_system/views/CONSTITUTION_INDEX.md` — detailed constitution registry

Records and posts (`6_posts/`) are NOT in INDEX by design — INDEX
covers the distilled and synthesised layers, not the raw stream.

The lens-specific instructions follow this frame. They describe what
this lens is looking for and which layer(s) it should treat as
primary. Beyond what the lens scopes, you choose:

  - which specific paths to read within the lens's primary layer
  - what time window to consider, and whether to widen it if a pattern
    asks for longer history
  - whether to consult this lens's own past outputs (see
    `Self-history` below for the lens's stance on this)

You write in free form. There is no required structure, no required
sections, no required citation count, no required confidence level,
no forbidden language. Write what you observe, in whatever shape is
honest. If you have nothing this run, say so plainly — that is signal,
not failure.

A separate, cheap LLM will read what you wrote and reformat it to the
canonical schema. You do not need to know the schema. Write for the
owner, not for the structurer.

Suggestions, not constraints — to make your output USEFUL (these are
strong recommendations because the owner will read what you wrote):

  - Pointing at specific records by path lets the owner verify what
    you saw. Vague references ("you wrote somewhere") force re-reading
    the whole base.
  - Naming an alternative interpretation ("or this could be noise
    because ...") gives the owner the counter-hypothesis. The owner
    is more likely to take an observation seriously when the
    counter-reading is also stated.
  - Stating uncertainty honestly ("I'm not sure", "this could be
    coincidence", "strong pattern across 5 records") is more useful
    than confident assertions.

These are descriptions of useful output, not requirements. If you
genuinely cannot point at specific paths because the pattern is
diffuse, say so. Honesty over format compliance.
```

## Stage 1 — Thinker prompt (lens-outputs-input variant)

For meta-lenses with `input_type: lens-outputs`. Different frame because
the input is hypothesis-grade (other lenses' observations), not records.

```
You are reading recent outputs of other agent-lenses. Each output file
is one lens's hypotheses about the owner's patterns. These are
HYPOTHESES, not facts about the owner.

Your role is navigator: surface to the owner what is happening across
the engine over the past week — lens system, process pipeline, lint
sweeps, candidate buffers, clarifications queue. The shape is a
status page, not analysis.

Available inputs (read whatever subset the lens prompt scopes you to):

  Agent-lens layer:
    _system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl     — machine index of lens runs
    _system/state/log_agent_lens.md         — human-readable lens log
    _system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md      — registry of declared lenses
    _system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/{date}.md  — individual lens outputs

  Engine state layer:
    _system/state/log_process.md            — `/ztn:process` runs
    _system/state/log_lint.md               — `/ztn:lint` runs
    _system/state/log_maintenance.md        — `/ztn:maintain` + bootstrap runs
    _system/state/BATCH_LOG.md              — process batch index (table)
    _system/state/PROCESSED.md              — processed-source ledger
    _system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md         — open clarifications queue
    _system/state/OPEN_THREADS.md           — strategic open threads
    _system/state/principle-candidates.jsonl — append-only principle buffer
    _system/state/people-candidates.jsonl   — append-only people buffer

  Registries (for "what should exist"):
    _system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md, FOLDERS.md, PEOPLE.md,
    PROJECTS.md, SOURCES.md, TAGS.md
    1_projects/PROJECTS.md (if scoped by lens prompt)

The lens prompt selects which inputs are in scope and which sections
of the digest to render. Default: read all of the above; render the
sections the lens prompt enumerates.

Hard constraint (this is a real constraint, unlike thinker frame above
which has none):

  You may reference second-order content (observations, principle
  candidates, people candidates, clarification items, batch entries,
  knowledge-note titles produced by /ztn:process) by:
    - identifier (lens-id, candidate hash, batch-id, clarification id)
    - timestamp / date / age in days
    - count / aggregate / status label / confidence label
    - SHORT TITLE only (the line after `## Observation N —`,
      the candidate's `suggested_type + suggested_domain` pair, the
      knowledge-note slug, the clarification's one-line hint)

  You may NOT cite the BODY of any of these as evidence for a claim
  about the owner. The body of an observation, the `body` field of
  a principle candidate, the `**Quote:**` field of a clarification,
  the `Pattern:`/`Evidence:`/`Alternative reading:` of any
  observation — none of these may be quoted, paraphrased, or
  synthesised. Doing so builds a theory on second-order content,
  which is the failure mode this constraint exists to prevent.

  Logs (`log_*.md`, `BATCH_LOG.md`, `PROCESSED.md`) are
  machine-state, not second-order content — you may read and quote
  them freely (counts, dates, F-codes, batch-ids, status lines).

  Registry rows (`AGENT_LENSES.md` table, `PROJECTS.md`,
  `PEOPLE.md`) are facts about declared structure — you may read
  metadata (id, status, cadence, tier) but NOT cite the prose
  description fields ("Lens summaries" sections, profile body,
  project description). These are second-order and subject to the
  same hallucination guard.

  Allowed:  "stalled-thread 2026-04-23 observation 1 — 'Office
            relocation decision' — 21 days old, no follow-up commit"
  Allowed:  "/ztn:lint last ran 2026-04-26; F.3 + F.5 fired"
  Allowed:  "5 principle-candidates appended this week (0 personal,
            5 bootstrap-raw-scan origin)"
  Allowed:  "CLARIFICATIONS open: 12; new this week: 0;
            types: people-bare-name × 7, thread-stale-warn × 4"
  Allowed:  "global-navigator was last active 14 days ago, scheduler
            has not fired"
  Forbidden: "the owner is avoiding the relocation decision, per
              stalled-thread"
  Forbidden: any synthesis across two or more lenses' outputs
  Forbidden: paraphrasing a principle-candidate body or a
             clarification quote

You may write in free form. The structurer will reformat.
```

## Self-history — per-lens, no default

Each lens MUST state its self-history stance explicitly in its
`prompt.md`. There is NO default. A lens that does not specify a
stance fails registry validation at load time.

Three valid stances:

- **fresh-eyes** — the lens does not read its own past outputs. The
  runner does not include them in the available paths description.
  Suitable for mechanical lenses that just look at current state
  (e.g. stalled-thread).

- **longitudinal** — the lens may read its past outputs as context.
  The lens prompt itself instructs the thinker how to use them
  (typically: "as context for whether this is a recurring or new
  pattern, NOT as evidence for new observations"). Risk: echo loop,
  self-confirmation. The lens author owns this risk.

- **lens-decides** — the lens prompt itself describes when to look at
  past outputs and when not to. The runner makes them available; the
  thinker chooses per run.

The choice goes in lens frontmatter as `self_history: fresh-eyes |
longitudinal | lens-decides`.

---

## Stage 2 — Structurer prompt

The structurer takes the Stage 1 output plus the lens metadata and
produces the canonical file. Runs as a separate LLM call.

```
You are a strict formatter. You receive:
  1. A free-form analysis from a thinker LLM.
  2. The canonical output schema (below).
  3. Lens metadata (id, run timestamp).

Job: rewrite the thinker's analysis into the schema. EXTRACT what
the thinker provided. Do NOT add observations, evidence, alternative
readings, or confidence levels the thinker did not state.

Specific rules:
  - If the thinker wrote one or more distinct observations, each
    becomes a `## Observation N — {short title}` section.
  - If the thinker named specific paths, list each as an Evidence bullet
    with the most relevant short quote or paraphrase the thinker gave.
  - If the thinker named no paths for an observation, write the Evidence
    section with a single bullet `- (no specific paths cited)`.
  - If the thinker offered a counter-reading or alternative
    interpretation, that goes in `**Alternative reading:**`. If not,
    write `unspecified`.
  - If the thinker stated confidence (in any phrasing — "strong",
    "I'm not sure", "could be noise"), map to low / medium / high.
    If not, write `unspecified`.
  - If the thinker explicitly said "no observations this run" or
    equivalent, produce frontmatter with `hits: 0` and a Reasons
    section quoting the thinker's stated reason.

Canonical schema:

---
lens_id: {id}
run_at: {ISO timestamp}
hits: {N}
origin: personal
audience_tags: []
is_sensitive: {false | true}
---

## Observation 1 — {short title}

**Pattern:** {1-3 sentences from thinker, lightly trimmed if long}

**Evidence:**
- {path or "(no specific paths cited)"} — "{quote or paraphrase}"
- {path} — "{...}"

**Alternative reading:** {what thinker said could be the noise
                         interpretation, or "unspecified"}

**Confidence:** {low | medium | high | unspecified}

## Observation 2 — ...

For zero-hit runs:

---
lens_id: {id}
run_at: {ISO timestamp}
hits: 0
origin: personal
audience_tags: []
is_sensitive: false
---

## Reasons

{thinker's stated reason for finding nothing}

Privacy-trio frontmatter is REQUIRED on every emission per
ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.8 (Tier-2 entity contract). Defaults:
  - `origin: personal` — lens output is owner-internal hypothesis-grade
    analysis; never `work` or `external`.
  - `audience_tags: []` — owner-only by construction; never widened
    automatically.
  - `is_sensitive: false` by default. Set `true` ONLY when the lens
    prompt explicitly surfaces sensitive patterns (relationship,
    conflict, health). The thinker / lens prompt signals when this
    applies; the structurer flips the bool.

Output the structured file content only. No commentary, no preamble.
```

---

## Stage 3 — Validator (structural, deterministic)

Runs after the structurer. Checks form, not content. Pass conditions:

- Frontmatter parses; contains `lens_id`, `run_at`, `hits` (integer ≥ 0)
- Privacy trio present and well-formed (ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.8):
  - `origin` exists; value ∈ {`personal`, `work`, `external`} (lens
    outputs default to `personal` and rarely diverge — but the field
    must be present)
  - `audience_tags` exists; value is a list (may be empty `[]`)
  - `is_sensitive` exists; value is a boolean
- If `hits == 0`: file has `## Reasons` section with at least one line
- If `hits > 0`:
  - Exactly `hits` `## Observation N` sections
  - Each Observation has `**Pattern:**`, `**Evidence:**`, `**Alternative
    reading:**`, `**Confidence:**` lines (all four required, in that
    order)
  - Evidence section has at least one bullet (may be `(no specific
    paths cited)`)
  - `**Confidence:**` value ∈ {low, medium, high, unspecified}
- Cited paths that look like ZTN paths (start with `_records/`,
  `1_projects/`, etc.) MUST resolve to existing files. Non-ZTN-path
  citations are allowed (the thinker may quote constitution by name,
  for example).

Missing or malformed privacy-trio fields fail the validator with
`rejection_reason: privacy-trio-{field}-missing-or-malformed`. The
structurer schema (Stage 2) is contracted to emit them with sane
defaults; validator failure here means structurer drift, not lens
content drift — owner inspects via `_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/`.

**Grandfathering — lens outputs written before the trio became
mandatory.** The validator runs at write time only; it never
revalidates files already on disk. Lens outputs in
`_system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/{date}.md` written before the trio
contract landed remain valid as historical observations and stay in
their original form on disk — consistent with the engine's append-only
log philosophy («logs document what happened; never edited
retroactively», ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.5). When the same lens runs again
on a future date, the new file gets the trio. No backfill, no
retroactive rewrite. If a same-date re-run overwrites a pre-trio
file, the new emission carries the trio (write-time validation
applies to the new content).

On validator failure:
- The output is NOT written to `_system/agent-lens/{id}/`
- A line goes into `_system/state/log_agent_lens.md` with run_at, lens_id,
  rejection reason, and a link to the rejected raw output saved in
  `_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/{lens-id}/{run_at}.md` for owner
  inspection
- A line goes into `agent-lens-runs.jsonl` with `status: rejected`
- 3 consecutive rejections of the same lens → runner flips status to
  `paused` in registry and surfaces in log; owner intervenes

The validator does NOT check semantic content. It does not verify the
observation is "good", "honest", or "well-grounded" — that is the
owner's review responsibility.
