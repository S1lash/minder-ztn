"""The write boundary — snapshots, attribution, remedy, and the leak scan.

`writes:` is a checked contract here, not an inability elsewhere: a role runs
with a shell and could write anywhere, so the guard compares what actually
changed against the role's allowlist and repairs the difference.

**Snapshots carry content digests, not just paths.** Paths alone cannot
attribute a modification: role A creates `…/state/x.md`, role B's snapshot
records it as dirty, B edits it, and git emits the identical status line — a
path-set difference removes it at step one and B's edit is invisible
forever. The digest is what makes attribution real.

Two snapshots, two jobs. The **role snapshot** is captured immediately
before each role; it drives attribution — a path is touched by this role
when its (presence, digest) differs between that snapshot and the current
state — and it is what the remedy branches on. The **tick baseline** is
captured once, before the first role, and its job is narrower: it labels an
unrestorable path in the REPORT as the owner's uncommitted work or an
earlier role's output. Nothing about safety depends on it.

**The remedy branches on RESTORABILITY, not on ownership.** The question is
not "whose is this" — it is "can the guard put this back exactly as it was
before this role ran?" If it cannot, the alternatives are to leave it or to
destroy it, and destroying it is never right. Decided only by whether the
path appears in the role snapshot: absent and untracked → delete, it did not
exist at role start; absent and tracked → restore from the index, since
absence from a status listing means it equalled HEAD; present → report only,
because the snapshot carries a digest and git does not hold that content, so
nothing can reproduce it.

That rule replaced an ownership branch that destroyed data: role A created a
file in its own zone, role B touched it out of B's zone, and the guard
deleted it — the path was absent from the TICK baseline, so it looked
revertible, and revert of an untracked file means delete. The residual is
named rather than hidden: a role CAN modify a path that was already dirty
and the guard will report it without undoing it. A hole that is reported is
recoverable; destroyed work is not.

`git status --porcelain -uall -z`, all three flags, always. `-uall` because a
wholly new directory otherwise collapses to a single entry and the check
inspects a directory instead of files. `-z` because git C-quotes any
non-ASCII path by default, so a state file the owner named in their own
script arrives octal-escaped — `"state/\\321\\200\\320\\260…"` — fails the
prefix check, and is deleted on every run. With `-z` a rename is two
NUL-separated fields — new path, then old — not `R old -> new`, and both
paths are classified independently.

The leak scan asks the same question, because it is the same question. A
leaking in-zone file the guard can restore exactly is reverted; one it
cannot — already dirty when this role started — is reported and left on
disk, because destroying a draft to remove a credential is the cure being
worse than the disease. The tick keeps it out of the commit, so the
credential stays where the owner can see it and never reaches history.

Nothing here ever runs git with a force flag, ever removes untracked files
in bulk, or ever touches `.git/`. Reverts are per-path.

**The guard's INPUT is watched as carefully as its output.** This module's
model is «the repository is what `git status` prints», and a role with a shell
controls both what it prints and when — so the snapshot carries the surface
that decides it, and a change to any part is a finding that aborts, in the same
class as a moved HEAD:

- every `.gitignore` git can see — tracked, untracked-visible, AND
  untracked-ignored, which is the one that matters: a rule of `*` matches
  itself, so plain status reports neither it nor what it hides. `ls-files
  --cached --others`, deliberately WITHOUT `--exclude-standard`, is what lists
  all three at once;
- `core.excludesFile` at merged scope, plus a digest of what it points at — set
  globally it lives outside the repository and survives every clone of it;
- the hooks directory's **contents**, not only `core.hooksPath` — the tick runs
  `git commit` per role, so a planted hook executes in the tick's own process;
- remotes, `.git/config`, and the index flag bits, each of which redirects or
  hides without writing a file the working-tree diff would show.

**Stated limitations. Each is open, and none is closed by anything above:**

- A path outside the repository is outside `git status` entirely. A role
  that writes outside the repo is invisible here — and a SYMLINK is one route
  to that, worth naming because it does not look like one: a link created
  inside the allowed zone is reported as an ordinary in-zone write, while what
  it writes through lands wherever it points. Verified: the link is attributed
  and remedied, the file it targeted outside the repo is not. This adds no
  capability a role with a shell lacks, so there is no machinery here for it;
  what it adds is a way for «wrote in zone» to read as bounded when it is not.
  A link pointing back INTO the repository is different and is handled: git
  reports the real path, so an out-of-zone target is attributed and reverted
  normally.
- A background process outlives the check. The settle interval and the
  second snapshot catch what is still in flight; they do NOT stop a patient
  attacker, who need only wait longer than the interval. The real fix is a
  process-group kill at the dispatcher, which is not this module's to make.
- Encodings are unbounded. The scan carries the raw value plus its base64,
  hex and percent-encoded forms, which closes the common cases and raises
  the cost — it does not close the class, and no exact-match scan can.
- An in-zone write is a legal channel by design. The guard judges WHERE a
  role wrote and whether a known credential appears; it does not judge what
  the role chose to say there.

    THE question behind the whole ignore surface, asked directly instead of

    proxy — and a poor one, because most changes to the rules hide nothing at
    all. This answers «did anything become invisible», which is the only
    reason the guard watches the rules in the first place.

    Ignore rules do not apply to TRACKED files: git reports a modification to
    one whatever any rule says. So the only payload an ignore rule can hide is
    an untracked path — and a path that is ignored now while it was not
    ignored before is exactly that, whether the rule is new or the file is.
    Both readings are worth stopping for: either the role wrote something into
    a place the guard cannot look, or it made such a place.

    A set that only SHRANK hid nothing — it made more of the tree visible, not
    less. That is the ordinary case when something outside the role rewrites
    `.git/info/exclude`, and it is why the harness doing so no longer reads as
    a role attacking the guard.

    A path that was ALREADY VISIBLE when the role started is discounted, and

    is only worth anything to a role that hides its OWN payload, and a file
    already on disk before it ran is not that. `git status -uall` lists every
    untracked path, so the role snapshot's `entries` is the full record of
    what was visible; a candidate found there existed first and was hidden
    afterwards by someone else's rule. This is the case that fires when the
    host adds its own runtime entries mid-run: its lock file was visible at
    role start, so it is discounted, while a payload the role created during
    the run is in no snapshot and survives the filter.
