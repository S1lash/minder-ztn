"""Tests for roles_context — what the role is given (CORE-SPEC §4).

Proves the six-part ordering, full placeholder substitution, the hard error on
a missing `_run-frame.md` against the tolerated-with-a-marker `_minder.md`, the
`constitution:` gate, the previous-run line, the state inventory, and the
budget rules — including the one that matters most: a single file larger than
the budget is INLINED and marked, never demoted to a name-only listing, because
a role whose job is to maintain one large document would otherwise regenerate
it from scratch and destroy the accumulated work while every surface reported
success.

Three absences, three deliberately different postures (§4): `_run-frame.md`
missing is a HARD ERROR (engine-owned, a broken install), while `_minder.md`
and `constitution-core.md` each yield their own marker and continue. Getting
those three the same way round is the difference between a role that runs
without its mechanics and one that stops for a regenerable view.

The budget counts FILE CONTENT only — header lines are not charged, so the
inventory of a role with many small files cannot be squeezed out by its own
headers.

Determinism: `now` is injected and timezone-aware; no wall clock, no network,
every fixture in a tmp dir.

INFERENCE, flagged (see the report): `{{REPO_ROOT}}` renders `repo` and
`{{BASE}}` renders `base` — the two arguments `build_context` is given.
