"""Tests for roles_guard — the write boundary (CORE-SPEC §3).

Every rule in §3.4 gets a test named after it, plus named SIBLINGS proving the
same check ACCEPTS an unusual-but-legitimate shape. The guard is the only
thing between an autonomous role and the owner's base, so a guard that reverts
a legitimate write is as bad as one that misses a violation — both end with
the owner switching the tick off.

Every test builds its own throwaway git repo in a tmp dir via
`_roles_fixture.init_repo`, drives git through subprocess argument lists, and
leaves `core.quotepath` at its DEFAULT so the `-z` requirement (§3.4 rule 1)
is genuinely exercised rather than configured away. The real repo is never
touched and no test reads the wall clock.

The digest snapshot (§3.1) is what makes attribution real: a path-set
difference loses role B's edit of a file role A created, because git emits the
identical status line. `attribute` is therefore always fed real snapshots from
`capture_snapshot`, never hand-built dicts.

Flatness (§3.5) rides on the prefix: `classify` takes `WritePrefix` objects, so
the guard holds no copy of the inbox path that `roles_config` already owns.
That is why this suite imports `WritePrefix` — the type, not `RoleConfig`;
`check` still takes prefixes, which `test_check_takes_prefixes_not_a_role_config`
keeps honest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED FIXTURE DIMENSIONS — read this before adding a test here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three defects reached `origin/main` past a large, green suite. All three were
the same failure, and it was NOT a missing assertion: it was a WORLD no
fixture had ever built. The tests checked the right things about the wrong
state, so no amount of sharpening the existing ones would have found them.

  1. STAGED BUT UNCOMMITTED. Every `git add` in the suite was immediately
     followed by a `git commit`, so no test ever left an entry sitting in the
     index across a `check`. `git checkout -- <path>` restores from the INDEX,
     so a role that staged its work made every revert a silent no-op while the
     guard reported success.

  2. OUT OF ZONE AND ALREADY DIRTY. Every leak fixture used `STATE_PREFIX`, so
     every constructed leak was in-zone. `reported_only` holds exactly the
     paths the guard deliberately leaves on disk — the one set guaranteed to
     survive a run was the one set never scanned, and a credential reached
     history through it.

  3. EACH ABORT BRANCH. `head_moved`, `git_surface` and `unsettled` revert
     nothing, so everything the role wrote survives. Any rule about what
     happens to a role's output has a different answer on these paths, and a
     suite that only ever exercises the main path cannot see it.

  4. AN ENCRYPTED STORE, AND A KEY THAT MAY BE ABSENT (§6). Credentials no
     longer sit in a plaintext file that is always readable. The store is
     committed ciphertext; the values exist only in a decrypted file outside
     the repository, and only while the tick holds the key. So «the guard has
     the values» is now a precondition rather than a given: a scan written
     against a base with no key, or with the store never materialised, tests
     a different world than the one a scheduled tick runs in.

So: when you add a rule here, ask what it does in each of those four states
before asking whether your assertion is sharp. A fifth will eventually join
the list — add it here when it bites, because a convention that lives only in
a review comment dies with the review.

class StagedChangeTests(unittest.TestCase):
    """A role that runs `git add` defeats every revert, silently.

    `git checkout -- <path>` restores the working tree FROM THE INDEX, not
    from HEAD, and `git ls-files` lists index entries. So once a role stages
    its work, the guard's revert is a no-op while `reverted` reports success —
    and the tick then commits the staged change.

    Not exotic: the owner's own hot-loaded canon instructs agents to `git add`
    after every edit, so an agent-run role staging its output is the expected
    case, not the strange one.

    Every assertion here checks BOTH surfaces. Content alone passes a fix that
    forgets the index; an index check alone passes one that forgets the file.
