"""Security tests.

The single-context dogfood model does NOT apply runtime scope narrowing:
all three scopes (shared / personal / sensitive) are visible everywhere.
These tests guard the invariants that still hold:

  S-1. Placeholder-status notes are excluded from every derived surface
       regardless of core / scope / applies_to (invariant #18).
  S-2. The consumer filter (applies_to inclusion) does narrow the harness
       view — a principle without `claude-code` in applies_to must never
       reach `_system/views/constitution-core.md`.
  S-3. The SOUL_VALUES_SCOPES constant is explicit and guarded — if it
       ever changes, the change is loud.
  S-4. ALL_SCOPES_VISIBLE is the exact set {shared, personal, sensitive}
       — adding a fourth scope or dropping one is a conscious act, not
       accidental.

When multi-user scenarios land (sharing to wife / friends, MCP tokens),
this file grows to cover the re-introduced scope filter.
