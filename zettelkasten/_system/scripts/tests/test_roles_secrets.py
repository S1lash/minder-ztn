"""Tests for roles_secrets — the encrypted store (CORE-SPEC §6).

The store is COMMITTED and the key is not: a plaintext file has to be
gitignored, and a gitignored file does not exist in a cloud clone, so an
outward-reaching role could never run on a Routine. The ciphertext travelling
in the owner's private repo is the named trade that buys the only
configuration where a scheduled outward role works at all.

Three properties carry that trade, and each has its own class below:

  - the DECRYPTED file is never inside the repository (`MaterialiseTests`),
    asserted through `git status` rather than through the path string,
    because being invisible to git is what stops it being staged;
  - a wrong key fails LOUDLY and COMPLETELY (`WrongKeyTests`) — never an
    empty store, never a partial one, never a silent «no secrets», which
    would turn a key mistake into a role that reports success while doing
    nothing;
  - each value is encrypted INDEPENDENTLY (`IndependenceTests`), so adding a
    credential leaves the others' ciphertext byte-identical and the diff is
    one line.

Lineage: this replaces a module the engine had and lost. The `secret://<ref>`
indirection is gone — a role now sources a file and uses `$NAME` — so the ref
parsing and the lowercase-slug name shape do not carry over. The key handling,
per-value independence, fail-closed decryption and blob I/O do, and the tests
for them are adapted rather than rewritten.

API NAMES: written before the module landed. `ZTN_ROLES_KEY` and the store
path are quoted verbatim from §6 and are not guesses; the function names
follow the recovered module wherever it still applies, and use §6.4's own
verbs (materialise / destroy) where it does not. Flagged for reconciliation.
