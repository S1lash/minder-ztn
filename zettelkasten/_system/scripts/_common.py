# Std-stream encoding — one owner for this half of the engine
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every helper here emits JSONL on stdout that a SKILL parses, and owner text is
# not ASCII. Python encodes std streams through the platform default — cp1252 on
# a stock Windows box — so a single Cyrillic note title raises
# `UnicodeEncodeError` and the helper dies mid-stream. Reading paths from a pipe
# fails the same way in the other direction.
#
# `scripts/lib/portable.py` is the engine-wide owner of this; the two script
# trees always ship together, so importing it is the normal path. The fallback
# exists because `_system/scripts/` must stay runnable on its own — migration
# `014` does exactly that, `cd`-ing here and importing `_common` with nothing
# else on the path. It duplicates one stdlib call, not a decision.

    Single source of truth for `/ztn:process` hub C/D, `/ztn:maintain`
    Step 4 hub linkage, and `lint_concept_audit.py` hub-pass logic.

    Derivation rules:
    - `origin` ← dominant origin across members (tie → `personal`)
    - `audience_tags` ← intersection of member audience_tags (only
      audiences ALL members agree on widen the hub)

    **Owner-vs-engine ownership contract via `_engine_derived`.** Hub
    frontmatter carries an `_engine_derived: [field, ...]` list that
    enumerates which trio fields the engine currently owns. Behaviour:

    - Field missing from frontmatter → engine derives, writes value,
      ADDS field name to `_engine_derived`. (First touch on a fresh
      hub leaves all three engine-owned, continuously re-derived.)
    - Field present AND its name in `_engine_derived` → engine
      RE-DERIVES on every call, overwriting prior engine value.
      Membership changed → trio updates automatically.
    - Field present AND name NOT in `_engine_derived` → owner edit;
      engine NEVER touches it. To re-engage the engine, owner removes
      the value AND adds the field name back to `_engine_derived` (or
      simply removes the value — engine re-adds the marker on next
      derive).

    Backward compatibility: if `_engine_derived` is absent and a trio
    field IS present, the engine treats it as owner-set (preserves
    it). This matches the legacy "set once, owner takes over"
    semantics for hubs created before the marker existed; new hubs
    get the marker on first derivation.

# currently means: a live entity, an entity on a different axis, or a retired
# identifier that must be read as its successor. Parsing it lives here rather
# than in a scanner because more than one consumer needs the same answer, and
# two parsers of one registry are two answers to one question.

# `hub-{id}-{something}` is a different identity that merely shares a prefix.

# ask it.

    indented ``---`` inside a block-scalar value — which ``yaml.safe_dump``
    can emit for a value that itself contains ``---`` — cannot be mistaken
    for the fence and mask a real heading below it. The opening probe stays
    tolerant (it only decides "is this a frontmatter file at all").

    This is a structural line invariant; a caller that must be certain a
    note is *usable* combines it with ``read_frontmatter(path) is not None``
    — the genuine corruption fails both, a benign parseable shape fails
    neither (so the AND at the call site suppresses false positives).

    Returns True when the file has no opening fence (nothing to misplace)
    or the column-0 closing fence precedes every ``## `` heading. Returns
    False when a ``## `` heading appears before the closing fence, or the
    opening fence never closes.

    `base` is the zettelkasten root (typically `repo_root()`).

    Implementation notes: deterministic, no LLM. Matches §2.1 reprocess-
    corpus branch of `/ztn:process` SKILL spec. Exposed so that the
    orchestrator can shell out for a single source-of-truth file list
    instead of reimplementing the walk per invocation.
