"""Deterministic calendar-aggregation reconciler for CALENDAR.md.

The calendar aggregate has the same silent-drop failure mode as TASKS.md (a
"regenerate from all notes" step the autonomous tick downgrades at scale), but
it cannot be reconciled the same way: the CALENDAR.md aggregate carries no stable
``^meeting-id`` (unlike ``^task-id`` in TASKS.md), source events frequently lack
an anchor, and dates are often fuzzy (``~середина 2026-07``, ranges). Keying by
(date, text) would be brittle and produce false positives.

So the check is deliberately COARSE: a note that carries at least one FUTURE
``📅`` line in its BODY but whose ``[[note-id]]`` appears in NO forward-facing
CALENDAR section (Recurring / Upcoming / Deadlines — everything except Past) has
had its events dropped wholesale. Per-event precision is not attempted; a note
with several future events, one of them aggregated, is considered covered.

**Coverage is partial and this is BEST-EFFORT, not a deterministic gate** (unlike
the task reconciler, which works because ``^task-id`` anchors are genuinely
authored). Many calendar events are synthesized from meeting PROSE and never
appear as a ``- 📅`` body line — those have no anchor a script can diff, so a drop
of a prose-only event is invisible here. This catches drops of ``📅``-anchored
events only. The durable protection is the nightly lint scan surfacing what it
CAN see; the in-process check is a best-effort assist, not a guarantee.

Read-only: never writes. ``/ztn:process`` Step 4.2 and the weekly lint scan both
call ``--report``; the update migration detects + nudges.

CLI:
  --report [--json] [--today YYYY-MM-DD]

``--today`` overrides the date used to decide "future" (for deterministic tests);
it defaults to the real current date.

Exit status: 0 on success (a backlog is not an error); 2 when the reconciler
itself could not run; 3 on a parser mismatch — forward-facing calendar lines
present but no note-id parsed, which must never be reported as a clean or
fully-orphaned result.
