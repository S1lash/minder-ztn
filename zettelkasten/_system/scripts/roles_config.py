"""The role file, the `writes:` allowlist, and every role-relative path.

Owns two things and nothing else:

1. Reading and validating `<base>/_system/roles/{id}/role.md` — frontmatter
   only. The prose body is the owner's own language and is never parsed,
   never split into sections, never inspected for headings. It is carried
   verbatim on ``RoleConfig.body``.
2. Every path a role owns — its directory, its ``state/`` tree, its
   ``log.jsonl``, its ``role.md`` — plus the repo-relative prefix shapes the
   ``writes:`` sugar expands to and the one home of the secrets file. No
   other module rebuilds any of them.

An unknown frontmatter key is refused. Silently ignoring one is how a role
ends up with no credential and reports success: a typo'd or stale key must
fail loudly at validate time, not produce a 401 at 07:00.

``secrets:`` is a **declaration** for preflight and for the diff scan, never
an isolation **boundary** — the role reads the secrets file itself, in its
own shell, so any role with a shell can read every credential in it. The
field exists so preflight can tell the owner a declared credential is
missing and so the leak scan knows what to look for; it grants and withholds
nothing.

Every read passes ``encoding="utf-8"`` explicitly. The locale default is
cp1252 on a Western Windows install, and a Cyrillic role body decoded
through it comes back as mojibake that the role would then rewrite into its
own memory.
