"""The encrypted credential store, and the decrypted file a role sources.

A plaintext store has to be gitignored, and a gitignored file DOES NOT EXIST
in a cloud clone. Cloud Routines start from a fresh checkout, so a role that
reaches an authenticated service could never run there — while a local
scheduler only runs while the machine is on. That combination made the
most-wanted capability unreachable in the only environment an owner without
an always-on machine can use.

So the store is **encrypted and committed**, and the key arrives per run from
the scheduler's own environment. The trade is named rather than implied: the
ciphertext lives in the owner's private repository, so a repo leak hands an
attacker ciphertext and not the key. That is a deliberate step down from «the
secret never leaves the machine», and it buys the only configuration in which
a scheduled outward-reaching role works at all.

Four properties, all load-bearing:

1. **Each value is encrypted independently**, so adding one credential never
   re-encrypts the rest and a diff shows exactly one changed line.
2. **The key is one env var**, `ZTN_ROLES_KEY`, one per base — never in git,
   never in a prompt body, never in a file this engine writes.
3. **`cryptography` is imported lazily**, so a base with no secrets neither
   needs the package nor breaks without it. PyYAML stays the only hard
   dependency.
4. **Fail-closed.** Every failure raises `SecretError`; nothing here ever
   returns an empty or partial store. Fernet is authenticated, so a wrong key
   fails immediately rather than yielding garbage — and the message says
   which variable is wrong and what to do, never echoing ciphertext or
   plaintext.

Names are resolvable WITHOUT the key: `names()` reads the store's keys, so a
preflight runs on a machine that has no key and still reports a credential
that is missing from the store.
