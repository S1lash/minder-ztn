# Engine scripts

Deterministic Python utilities for the engine — constitution layer,
concept and audience format autofix, batch JSON manifest emission,
shared frontmatter helpers. No LLM. PyYAML is the single external
dependency.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r _system/scripts/requirements.txt
```

Works on any Python ≥ 3.9 with PyYAML ≥ 6.0.

## Scripts

All scripts support `--dry-run` and print to stderr on failure with a non-zero
exit code. Paths are resolved relative to the zettelkasten repo root; override
via the `ZTN_BASE` env var if running from outside the repo. All outputs live
inside the repo — scripts never write to `$HOME`. Consumers (Claude Code
harness) set up a symlink once per machine:
`ln -s $ZTN_BASE/_system/views/constitution-core.md ~/.claude/rules/constitution-core.md`.

| Script | Purpose | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_constitution_index.py` | Regenerate `_system/views/CONSTITUTION_INDEX.md` — full registry table with stats. | `_system/views/CONSTITUTION_INDEX.md` |
| `gen_constitution_core.py` | Regenerate `_system/views/constitution-core.md` — harness core view (all scopes, filtered by `applies_to: claude-code` and `status != placeholder`). | `_system/views/constitution-core.md` |
| `pipeline_health.py` | When each pipeline and role last ran — the one owner of that fact. Takes the MAXIMUM run timestamp, never the last header in the file: the logs are not in one order, and `log_lint.md` keeps its oldest seven entries at the bottom, so its last header is weeks older than its newest run. Read-only. | stdout (`--json` for machine use) |
| `archive_buffer.py` | Generic archive + verify + clear for weekly-aggregation buffers. Used by `/ztn:lint` F.3 (`principle-candidates.jsonl`) and C.5 (`people-candidates.jsonl`). Exit 2 on verify failure (buffer preserved). Archive filename uses buffer stem as prefix. | `_system/state/lint-context/weekly/{YYYY-WW}-{buffer-stem}-archived.jsonl` |
| `append_person_candidate.py` | Append a bare-name mention to `_system/state/people-candidates.jsonl`. Invoked by `/ztn:process` Step 3.8 when a first name cannot be resolved to a `firstname-lastname` PEOPLE.md id. `/ztn:lint` Scan C.5 aggregates weekly. | `_system/state/people-candidates.jsonl` |
| `query_constitution.py` | Emit JSON of visible active principles filtered by consumer / domains. Consumed by `/ztn:check-decision` + `/ztn:lint`. | stdout |
| `append_candidate.py` | Append a principle candidate to `_system/state/principle-candidates.jsonl` with schema validation + advisory file lock. Backing for `/ztn:capture-candidate`. | `_system/state/principle-candidates.jsonl` |
| `record_decision_run.py` | Append a `/ztn:check-decision` telemetry line (run or followup) to `_system/state/check-decision-runs.jsonl`. Atomic JSONL append under co-located `flock`; sensitive-redaction (omits situation_text + rationale, keeps situation_hash); per-class auto-commit (judgmental → path-specific commit; mechanical via `--from-pipeline` → skip, parent pipeline owns batch commit); graceful fallback if git fails (warn + return 0, JSONL is source of truth). Followup mode validates run_id format + existence in substrate, refuses orphan appends. | `_system/state/check-decision-runs.jsonl` |
| `render_soul_values.py` | Render the Values auto-zone inside `_system/SOUL.md`, bounded by markers. Detects manual drift. | `_system/SOUL.md` (only between markers) |
| `compact_evidence_trail.py` | Collapse Evidence Trail entries older than a cutoff into one `[compacted]` summary. Invoked only after the owner approves an `evidence-trail-compact` CLARIFICATION. | single `.md` file under `0_constitution/` |
| `lint_concept_audit.py` | Autonomous Scan A.7 + Step 1.D privacy-trio backfill for `/ztn:lint`. Walks frontmatter on records / knowledge notes / hubs / person and project profiles; normalises `concepts:` via `_common.py::normalize_concept_list`; filters `audience_tags:` against canonical 5 + AUDIENCES.md active extensions; backfills missing privacy trio fields with conservative defaults; coerces `is_sensitive` to bool, `origin` to enum. Emits JSONL fix events on stdout. NEVER raises CLARIFICATIONs — concept layer is fully autonomous (see ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.1). Idempotent on a clean state. | frontmatter of in-scope `.md` files (in `--mode fix`) |
| `emit_batch_manifest.py` | Producer-side JSON manifest emitter for `/ztn:process` Step 5.5 and `/ztn:maintain` Step 6.6. Reads structured batch data (stdin or `--input`), recursively normalises every concept-list field (`concept_hints` / `member_concepts` / `applies_in_concepts` / `concept_ids` / `related_concepts` / `previous_slugs`), filters `audience_tags[]` against the whitelist, coerces privacy trio types, drops `concepts.upserts[]` entries with unnormalisable name. Writes conformant JSON to `_system/state/batches/{batch_id}.json`. Format contract: `_system/docs/manifest-schema/` (`v{N}.json` + `README.md`). | `_system/state/batches/{batch_id}.json` |
| `render_index.py` | Regenerate `_system/views/INDEX.md` — surface-line catalog of knowledge (`1_projects` / `2_areas` / `3_resources`) + archive (`4_archive`, marker `[archived]`) + constitution (`0_constitution/{axiom,principle,rule}`, marker `tier N`) + hubs (`5_meta/mocs`, with inbound count). Faceted by PARA + `domains:` + cross-domain. Records and posts intentionally out of scope. Atomic write via `.tmp` + rename. Invoked by `/ztn:bootstrap` Step 5.5, `/ztn:maintain` Step 7.6, and `regen_all.py`. | `_system/views/INDEX.md` |
| `render_hub_maps.py` | Regenerate `## Хронологическая карта` AUTO-GENERATED block inside hubs with `chronological_map_mode: derived`. Anchored insert / replace; honours `excluded_from_map[]`. Invoked by `/ztn:maintain` Step 7.7. | `5_meta/mocs/*.md` (only the marked block) |
| `regen_all.py` | Convenience runner that invokes the derived-views generators in dependency order: `gen_constitution_index` → `gen_constitution_core` → `render_index` → `render_soul_values`. Fail-fast on non-zero exit; the SOUL step is skipped with an info message (still exit 0) when markers are absent on a fresh base — `--strict-soul` makes that a failure instead. | (delegates) |
| `repair_split_names.py` | Rejoin an inbox item whose name a producer's `/` split into two nested directories — a shape `normalize_portable_name` cannot reach, because both resulting segments are legal names. Joins ONLY when the parent holds exactly one child that is itself a complete item; every other shape is reported for a `source-layout-split-name` CLARIFICATION and left in place. Invoked by `/ztn:process` §0.0a, backstopped by `/ztn:lint` A.10a. | `_sources/inbox/**` (rename only, in `--apply`) |
| `build_concept_registry.py` | Build the canonical concept registry (`_system/registries/concepts.jsonl`) by walking notes/hubs frontmatter; aggregates type / mention counts / first-seen / last-seen. Invoked by `/ztn:lint` Scan A.7 / autonomous concept layer. | `_system/registries/concepts.jsonl` |
| `lint_hub_integrity.py` | Scan hub frontmatter and body for structural integrity (markers, member back-refs, derived-trio consistency). Read-only; emits findings as JSONL on stdout. Used by `/ztn:lint` Scan A.4. | stdout |
| `identity_audit.py` | Resolve every surface an identifier appears on — membership field (`projects:` / `people:`), `{namespace}/{id}` tag, `[[id]]` wikilink (bare, labelled, sectioned or path-form), node card, node container, hub, registry row, tag-registry row — against **every** registry, and report what still names a retired or mis-classified identity. One procedure, N registries: each registry declares its own roles, node directory and tag namespaces in a `RegistrySpec`, so the people registry's «no node container, no hub» is data and a third registry is a third spec, not a third code path. Matching is exact identifier equality, never substring; a link inside backticks or a fenced block is quoted documentation, not a surface. **Coverage is inverted:** the base is walked whole and every markdown path is classified live / derived / immutable by rule — a path no rule claims is itself a finding, because an allowlist of scanned roots fails GREEN. The class line runs INSIDE a record file: frontmatter migrates, the body is history and is never residue. Successors resolve **transitively** to the terminal live identity, and a walk that does not terminate (cycle, void, foreign registry, missing row) yields no target and is reported against the registry row. Registry-row integrity is judged before the surface walk, so a malformed row is reported once and suppresses every automatic rewrite for that identity. Two identities are never reported: a `void` retirement (frozen by the contract) and the owner — the latter only for the registry that declares the owner, since applying it everywhere silently un-audits a project whose identifier collides with a slug transliterated out of SOUL.md prose. Every finding carries a machine `kind` from a closed set (`REASON_CODES`) so a consumer can deduplicate on it. Read-only. Default mode is the drift event stream (JSONL, exit 0) used by `/ztn:lint`, which also carries the hub-kind agreement check; `--report [--json]` prints the identity report; `--fail-on-residue` exits 2 on residue; `--identity {id}` restricts report, counts and exit code to one identifier and exits 1 when no registry declares it. | stdout |
| `identity_gate.py` | Run the per-identity residue scan and **record that it ran** — one append-only line in `_system/state/identity-gate.jsonl` naming the command, its exit code, the residue count and the commit it ran against. Identity Contract Obligation 4 makes the recorded scan part of a resolution; without this the number in a resolution payload is a claim the writer made about itself, indistinguishable afterwards from a fact. Holds no opinion of its own: it shells `identity_audit.py` and passes its exit code straight through (0 clean / 1 unknown or could-not-run / 2 residue). Separate from the audit because the audit is read-only by design and this writes. | `_system/state/identity-gate.jsonl` + stdout |
## Shared `_common.py` helpers

Functions imported by the scripts above; consumers of the engine
SKILLs reference them as the single source of truth for autonomous
resolution.

| Helper | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `normalize_concept_name(raw) -> str \| None` | CONCEPT_NAMING.md normalisation: diacritic-fold, lowercase, separator→`_`, ASCII guard, bare-reserved-word drop, length truncate. Type prefixes are NOT stripped — names kept verbatim. Returns `None` to signal silent drop. |
| `normalize_concept_list(raw_iter) -> list[str]` | Apply normalize_concept_name to each entry; drop Nones; dedupe preserving first-seen order. |
| `normalize_audience_tag(raw) -> str \| None` | AUDIENCES.md normalisation: kebab-case ASCII, length 2-32. Returns the well-formed value or `None` to drop. Caller checks against whitelist. |
| `recompute_hub_trio(hub_fm, member_trios) -> tuple[dict, list[dict]]` | Hub privacy derivation — dominant origin / audience intersection / sensitivity contagion. Owner-edit preservation: only fills missing fields; never overwrites. |
| `parse_project_registry(root) -> dict[str, RegistryEntry]` | The single parser of `1_projects/PROJECTS.md`. Per identifier: category (`project` / `trajectory` / `consolidated`), the successor identifier a retirement row names, and the raw status cell. Empty mapping when the registry is missing or unreadable. |
| `registry_ids_by_category(registry) -> dict[str, set[str]]` | `{category: {identifier, ...}}` view over a parsed registry, for consumers that only need membership. |
| `read_frontmatter(path) -> tuple[dict, str] \| None` | Generic YAML frontmatter reader, tolerant of read / parse errors (returns None). |
| `write_frontmatter(path, fm, body)` | Round-trip writer preserving body verbatim; sort_keys=False, allow_unicode=True. |

## Run from scheduled tasks (Claude platform)

The scripts are stateless and CLI-driven. To run from a scheduled agent:

1. `pip install -r _system/scripts/requirements.txt` (once).
2. Set `ZTN_BASE=/absolute/path/to/zettelkasten` so path resolution is
   independent of the agent's CWD.
3. Invoke the script by absolute path, e.g.
   `python3 $ZTN_BASE/_system/scripts/gen_constitution_index.py`.

All writes are idempotent (same inputs → same outputs) so safe to re-run.

## Tests

Stdlib `unittest` only — no pytest dependency.

```bash
cd _system/scripts
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Schema & invariants

- `0_constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` — authoritative schema for the
  constitution layer; scope semantics; writeability matrix.
- `_system/registries/CONCEPT_NAMING.md` — concept-name format spec
  + autonomous-resolution table.
- `_system/registries/AUDIENCES.md` — audience-tag whitelist + spec
  + Extensions table.
- `_system/docs/batch-format.md` — batch format contract (markdown
  report + JSON manifest).
- `_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` §3.1 — surface-don't-decide rule
  + concept layer autonomous-resolution exception.

The scripts mirror these specs; any discrepancy is a bug in the
scripts.
