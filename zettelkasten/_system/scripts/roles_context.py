"""What one role is given — the assembled prompt for a single run.

Reads, never writes. Six parts in a fixed order, each starting on its own
line so a mechanic and an instruction can never share one:

1. `_system/roles/_run-frame.md`, rendered. Engine-owned, ships as a
   template, and this module only substitutes placeholders into a copy —
   the file on disk is never touched. Its ABSENCE IS A HARD ERROR: it means
   a broken install, and tolerating it would run a role with no mechanics.
   The one thing the renderer decides rather than substitutes: a role that
   declares no `secrets:` never sees the credentials passage at all. Handing
   it the store's path and the recipe to source it is a map it never asked
   for, and an invitation to fail over credentials it never had.
2. `_system/roles/_minder.md` verbatim, or a marker. It is prose, and a role
   can still do useful work without it.
3. `_system/views/constitution-core.md` verbatim, only when the role asked
   for it, or a marker. A derived view's absence means the owner never
   regenerated it, not that the install is broken — deliberately a different
   posture from the run frame.
4. The previous run line. Without it a role cannot detect that its
   predecessor died mid-flight, and it will redo an already-performed
   outward act.
5. The role's own body, verbatim and unparsed.
6. The inventory of its `state/` tree.

`{{NOW_LOCAL}}` exists because a role whose question is "the last week" must
not derive today's date from the ambient harness: under an injected `--now`
the runner and the role would disagree about what day it is.

Budget: content only. Header lines are not charged against it, so the
inventory of a role with many small files cannot be squeezed out by its own
headers. A file larger than what REMAINS of the budget is inlined up to what
remains and marked INSIDE its own block, never demoted to a name-only entry —
a role whose entire job is to maintain one large document would otherwise be
handed the name of the file it must update and none of its content, and
would regenerate it from scratch, destroying the accumulated work while
every surface reported success. Only when nothing remains does a file join
the `[state truncated: N more files]` listing, because a truncated block with
no content under it tells the role less than a name and a size do.

Every read passes `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly; a file that is not
decodable is listed as binary and never inlined.

    exists because context is finite, and it invites an `error` outcome over
