"""The roles CLI — one verb per step of a tick. Composes, owns no domain logic.

Cadence arithmetic lives in `roles_cadence`, the role schema and every path
in `roles_config`, git plumbing in `roles_guard`, the prompt in
`roles_context`, the run line in `roles_log`. This module parses arguments,
calls them in order, and prints. Anything here that reasoned about a date or
a diff would be a second home for a fact one of those modules owns.

    roles_run.py base       --repo R
    roles_run.py secrets-open  --base B   → decrypts the store, prints the path
    roles_run.py secrets-close --base B   → removes it; safe if never opened
    roles_run.py due        --base B --repo R [--now ISO]
    roles_run.py context    --base B --repo R --role ID [--now ISO]
    roles_run.py tick-begin --base B --repo R
    roles_run.py role-begin --base B --repo R --role ID
    roles_run.py check      --base B --repo R --role ID
    roles_run.py log        --base B --role ID --outcome O --ms N
                            [--writes N] [--note TEXT] [--ts ISO]
                            [--reverted JSON] [--reported-only JSON]
    roles_run.py validate   --base B --repo R [--role ID]
                            → {"ok":bool,"findings":[...],"notes":[...]}

Every verb prints JSON except `context`, which prints the prompt itself, and
`base`, which prints one path. `base` exists because «where is the base» is a
fact and a fact has one home: the base directory name is not a constant, so
every caller had to derive it, and three prose files derived it three ways
with three different behaviours on failure. Zero candidates or several is a
loud error here, never an empty string — an empty base is how a renamed base
becomes a tick reporting «no roles due» every night with every surface green.

`due` reports EVERY role with an explicit `due` boolean, so "not due" and
"missing" are never confused. A role whose file is malformed comes back
`due: false` with the error as its reason: the tick surfaces it and carries
on, because one broken role must never abort a tick.

Snapshots live in a per-tick directory under the OS temp directory, whose
name is derived from the repository path — so `check` finds the role
snapshot by convention, and nothing about them lands in the repo. `check`
deletes the role snapshot once it has used it; the tick removes the
directory when it finishes.

`validate` is deterministic and offline by design. Whether a credential
actually works is the creation-time trial run's job; a preflight that
reached out over the network would be non-deterministic and would fail on a
plane. Its findings are unconditional (§7.2): a declared secret with no
resolvable value is named whether the secrets file is missing a key or
missing entirely, because a clean result is the concierge's gate and a
silence here becomes a role that reports success while doing nothing. A role
declaring no secrets on a base with no secrets file is clean — the rule is
about a declared name having no value, never about the file's existence.

`validate` separates blockers from notes. `findings` are blockers and `ok` is
`not findings`, unchanged; `notes` is advisory and never moves `ok`. The one
note today is the unreachable time anchor (§2.1): a `daily 14:00` role never
fires under a once-daily 07:00 tick, but the same cadence is correct on a
scheduler that ticks more often, and this engine cannot see the owner's cron.
A warning that blocked would refuse a working shape; a warning folded into
`findings` would flip the concierge's gate on the commonest cadence there is.
