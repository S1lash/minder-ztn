"""When did each pipeline last run — the one answer, for every reader.

WHY THIS EXISTS

«Is lint still running?» had no owner. Every reader worked it out for itself
from the prose of an append-only log, and the cheap reading — *the last `## `
header in the file* — is wrong, because the logs are not in one order.

`log_lint.md` is the case that cost the most. Its newest entry sits at the TOP
(the file says so, in a marker at line 26: «Entries append BELOW this line,
newest first»), while the last seven entries, written before that convention,
remain at the bottom in ascending order. So the FINAL header in the file is
`2026-06-08` and the newest entry is `2026-07-28`. Anything taking the last
header concluded the pipeline had been dead for fifty days while it was
delivering nightly — and the routine really did stop for twelve days inside
that window, invisibly, because the surface that would have shown it was
already reporting a much older date.

`log_maintenance.md` has the same split, five days wide instead of fifty. It is
the same defect; only the blast radius differed.

WHAT IT DOES

Reads every pipeline log, extracts every run timestamp, and returns the
**maximum** — never the last one in file order. Order-agnostic by construction,
so no log has to be rewritten and no future ordering change can break it.

Four header shapes exist today and all four are real:

    ## 2026-07-28T01:09:09Z | lint | by: ztn:lint       log_lint.md
    ## 2026-08-08 — Processing: activitywatch …         log_process.md
    ## 2026-05-01 11:38:00Z — agent-lens run            log_agent_lens.md
    ## 2026-08-08T… or ## 2026-08-08 — …                log_maintenance.md

Roles are not a markdown log at all — each role keeps `log.jsonl`, one object
per executed run — so they are read from there and reported per role.

Usage:
    python3 pipeline_health.py --base <base> [--json] [--now ISO8601]

Exit code is 0 whatever it finds: this reports, it does not judge. A caller
that wants a staleness threshold applies its own.
