"""Identity audit — one identifier, eight surfaces, one verdict.

The registry decides what an identifier means. The identifier itself lives in
eight places. Auditing one of them lets a retirement reach the registry and stop
there, which is how a decision recorded once survives only as long as the author
remembered to carry it. This scanner resolves every surface against the registry
and reports what still names a retired or mis-classified identifier.

**Matching is exact identifier equality, never substring.** A hub whose own
identifier merely CONTAINS a retired one is a different identity that happens to
share a prefix — it is not a surface of that identity and is never reported as
one.

Surfaces, per the identity contract — roles, not paths:

  field              the membership array entry (`projects:`, `people:`)
  tag                `{namespace}/{id}` in `tags:`
  wikilink           `[[id]]`, `[[id|label]]`, `[[id#section]]`, `[[path/id]]`
  node-card          the identity's own `.md` file in its registry's node dir
  node-container     the identity's own folder in its registry's node dir
  hub                the hub whose own `id:` is this identity's hub identifier
  registry-row       the row in the registry that declares the identity
  tag-registry-row   the row declaring `{namespace}/{id}` in the tag registry

**Which roles exist is a property of the registry, not of this code.** Each
registry declares its surfaces, its node directory, its membership field and
its tag namespaces in a `RegistrySpec`; the scan below is written once against
those declarations. A registry that does not declare a role does not have it —
the people registry has no node container and no hub, and says so as data. A
third registry is a third `RegistrySpec`, not a third branch. That is the
contract's own sanity test: a new kind of identity that needs a special rule
inside the procedure, rather than a row in its registry's declaration, means
the procedure is written wrong.

**Coverage is inverted, not enumerated.** The scan walks the whole base and
classifies every markdown path by rule; a path no rule claims is itself a
finding (`surface_class: "unclassified"`), counted as residue. An allowlist of
scanned roots fails GREEN — it proves only that the paths someone remembered
are clean, and this engine grows by adding top-level regions. Inverting it
makes the contract's own doctrine — silence needs a detector — something the
code does rather than something the document claims.

Two identities are never reported, and both exclusions are principled rather
than convenient:

  the owner    named by `SOUL.md → ## Identity → Name:` (or by the registry's
               own owner section once it has one). The owner's identifier is
               on hundreds of live surfaces and in no registry table; a check
               that reads "absent from the registry, therefore drift" would
               call the owner of the base garbage.
  void kinds   a retirement of the `void` kind never had a successor, so its
               references are frozen where they stand rather than migrated,
               and are excluded from the residue check by the contract itself.

A node surface reported for relocation pulls its inbound links in with it: every
wikilink resolving to that node is live work too (`action: repoint`, target = the
canonical node by the resolution order hub → card → container README). Reporting
the node alone would let the gate pass a graph that breaks the moment the node
moves. For a RETIRED identifier those links are already residue and stay
`migrate` — a repoint means the identity lives on and only its node moved.

Surface classes decide what a finding MEANS, and exist so that "no residue" can
never be satisfied by rewriting history:

  live          migrates — notes, cards, containers, hubs
  derived       regenerates — views and aggregates; migrating them is a category
                error, the next rebuild overwrites the edit
  immutable     never touched and never reported — raw sources, append-only
                state, lens output, manifests with their own checksums, and the
                BODY of any record
  unclassified  no rule claims this path, so nothing has decided what it is.
                Reported as residue, because a scan that silently skips what it
                does not recognise is a scan whose green verdict means nothing.

The record split is inside the file, not at the folder: a record's frontmatter
is engine-managed classification and migrates like any other live surface,
while its body is a historical artifact. A record whose frontmatter names a
retired identity is residue; a record whose prose mentions it is history, and
demanding that history be rewritten is the one thing the contract forbids.

Two modes, because one caller wants an event stream and the other wants a gate:

  default            the drift event stream (JSONL on stdout), exit 0 — the
                     nightly scan's contract, plus the hub-kind check, which
                     belongs to the scan that already holds the registry
  --report [--json]  the identity report: findings grouped per identifier
  --fail-on-residue  exit non-zero when residue exists, so a gate can be built
                     on it at all
  --identity {id}    restrict the report, the counts and the exit code to one
                     identifier. The completion gate is per-identity while the
                     audit is global, so a caller reading a whole-base verdict
                     as its own reverts a correct migration because something
                     unrelated is dirty. Other identities' findings are dropped
                     from the output entirely, not merely uncounted

A filtered run reports which of three things happened, because all three exit
0 and only the first is what a reader assumes (`identity_scope` in `--json`):

  audited       the identity was scanned; the residue count is real and the
                verdict prints as `clean: True/False`
  set-aside     auditable in principle, but every registry that holds it set
                it aside (a `void` retirement, the owner row)
  out-of-scope  declared and live, so no registry audits it — a live
                identifier on its own axis is where it belongs

The last two print `NOT AUDITED ({scope})` with the reason, never `clean`:
zero buckets and a clean scan are different facts and must not share a word.

Exit status:
  0  ran; no residue, or residue found without --fail-on-residue, or nothing
     applies to the filtered identity (see the three scopes above — read the
     scope, not the exit code, to tell «no residue» from «no check»)
  1  could not run — the root does not exist, or `--identity` names an
     identifier no registry declares. Never 0: the ordinary causes are a typo
     and a retirement row that never landed, and reading "unknown" as "clean"
     closes a change against nothing
  2  residue present, with --fail-on-residue

Usage:
    python3 identity_audit.py [--root <path>]
    python3 identity_audit.py --report --json [--root <path>]
    python3 identity_audit.py --report --fail-on-residue

    Five shapes, all of which resolve to the same node: `[[id]]`, `[[id|label]]`,

    whenever a bare name would be ambiguous, and the table form `[[id\|label]]`
    whose pipe is backslash-escaped because an unescaped one would end the
    markdown cell. Missing the path form is not a smaller version of the same
    check — it is a link the migration will not find, in the one situation (a
    duplicated name) where the base already told us the graph is delicate. The
    table form is the same failure with the opposite frequency: every hub map

    The optional prefix must end in `/`, which is what keeps

# Successor integrity — resolved once per identity, before any surface is read
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two things were wrong with reading `entity.successor` at each surface.
#
# It resolves ONE HOP. `A→B→C` yields B, so applying the audit's own work list
# produces fresh residue: every reference to A now names an identifier that is
# itself retired. The contract's reader resolves to the TERMINAL LIVE successor,
# which means walking the chain — and refusing when the walk does not end in a
# live identifier, rather than handing back the last thing it saw.
#
# And it reports a defect of the ROW once per REFERENCE. A `rename` that names
# no successor produced four findings all targeting nothing and no complaint
# about the row that caused them. The row is the thing that is wrong, it is
# wrong once, and until it is fixed there is no deterministic target — so a
# malformed row suppresses every automatic rewrite for that identity.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reason codes — the machine half of every finding
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every finding carries a `kind`, and these are the whole vocabulary of it. The
# consumer keys deduplication on this value, so a code the consumer has to mint
# for itself differs between nights and the same finding re-surfaces as new
# forever. A prose `reason` cannot carry that weight: it is written for a human
# and it changes whenever the sentence improves.
#
# `kind` on a FINDING is the kind of problem. `kind` on an IDENTITY is the kind
# of identity change (merge / rename / split / void). Both names are right in
# their own frame and the event stream already spells the first one `kind`, so
# a finding also carries `change_kind` for the second rather than renaming
# either.
