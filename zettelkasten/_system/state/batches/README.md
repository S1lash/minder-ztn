# `_system/state/batches/` — engine output directory

Canonical location for the ZTN engine's append-only manifest output.
Every persistent-state-changing run of `/ztn:process`, `/ztn:maintain`,
`/ztn:lint`, or `/ztn:agent-lens` writes one pair of files into this
directory: a machine-contract `.json` and a human-narrative `.md`.

This README documents the **directory's** contract — naming,
ordering, retention, the JSON / MD pair, archive convention, and
backup. The **schema** content of the JSON files is documented in
[`_system/docs/manifest-schema/README.md`](../../docs/manifest-schema/README.md)
and pinned by [`v2.json`](../../docs/manifest-schema/v2.json).

---

## 1. Purpose

One pair of files per batch:

- **`{ts}-{skill}.json`** — machine contract. Validated against
  `manifest-schema/v2.json` by `/ztn:lint` Scan H. Required for any
  consumer integration.
- **`{ts}-{skill}.md`** — human-facing narrative summary. Owner-
  oriented, not schema-validated, not consumed programmatically.

Both files share the same `{ts}-{skill}` stem. Consumers integrating
with the engine output read `.json` only; the `.md` is for manual
review of what a batch produced.

---

## 2. Naming convention

```
{ts}-{skill}.json
{ts}-{skill}.md
```

- `{ts}` — sortable string `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` UTC. Lexicographic sort
  on this prefix is monotone in time.
- `{skill}` — one of `process`, `maintain`, `lint`, `agent-lens`.
  Matches the manifest's top-level `processor` field with the
  `ztn:` prefix stripped.

Active state contains only `{ts}-{skill}.{json,md}` per the
naming above. Pre-JSON-manifest markdown summaries
(2026-04-17 → 2026-04-30) are archived under
`archive/v1-pre-manifest/` for historical reference; consumers
ignore that subdirectory.

---

## 3. Ordering

Per ARCHITECTURE.md §8.11.2 (one specific downstream consumer's
ordering spec, in the minder-project repo) — *the canonical sort
key is the filename's timestamp prefix.* Consumers MUST NOT
rely on filesystem `ctime` / `mtime`: those change on copy, move,
`git restore`, clone-into-fresh-tree, or any rsync. Filename time
survives all of them.

Within the same `{ts}`, the cross-skill lock matrix
(ZTN doctrine §3.4) defines order:

```
process → maintain → lint → agent-lens
```

Skills cannot run in parallel under that matrix, so within any one
wall-clock second one and only one new batch lands. Equal-`{ts}`
ties between skill manifests are resolved by this skill order.

---

## 4. Idempotency

The manifest's top-level `batch_id` field is the **idempotency key**
for downstream consumers. Re-reading a manifest with a `batch_id`
already processed downstream MUST be a no-op.

- Reading the same `batch_id` twice is safe.
- Writing two different files with the same `batch_id` is a contract
  violation. The schema validator does not check this — the writer
  side (engine) and the reader side (consumer) are both expected to
  uphold it.
- `batch_id` uniqueness is preserved across archived batches too —
  if a consumer chooses to read the `archive/` subdirectory, replay
  remains safe.

---

## 5. The JSON / MD pair

| File | Purpose | Validated | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{ts}-{skill}.json` | Machine contract | Yes — `manifest-schema/v2.json` via `/ztn:lint` Scan H | Any downstream consumer |
| `{ts}-{skill}.md` | Owner-facing narrative | No | Humans only |

Two files, same stem. They are written by the same skill in the
same run; absence of one does not invalidate the other. (See §6 for
why the producer does not need both to be atomically co-written.)

---

## 6. Append-only retention

ZTN never deletes batches. There is no automated cleanup, no
retention cron, no time-based pruning. The directory grows
monotonically; archival is an owner-driven move (§7), not a delete.

### Write semantics

`_system/scripts/emit_batch_manifest.py` writes manifests atomically
via `.tmp` + `os.replace()`: payload lands at
`{output}.tmp`, then a single `os.replace(tmp, output)` swaps it
into place. On POSIX `os.replace` is atomic, so any consumer
observing `{ts}-{skill}.json` sees the complete manifest or nothing.
On crash mid-write the `.tmp` artifact is unlinked best-effort and
the exception is re-raised; no partial JSON ever appears at the
final path.

### Validator baseline

Pre-validator-baseline batches (older than the timestamp recorded
in `_system/state/batches/.validator-baseline`) are skipped by
Scan H. Reason: legacy batches predate the schema's required
sections and would surface as false-positive failures. Append-only
philosophy applies — those batches are kept verbatim and excluded
from validation, never rewritten to fit the current shape.

The baseline file is created by `lint_manifest_schema.py
--init-baseline` on the first nightly run after Wave 1; once
written, it is itself append-only against retroactive edits.

---

## 7. Owner-archive convention

Path: `_system/state/batches/archive/{YYYY-MM}/`

- Move-to-archive is **owner-driven**, never automated. Trigger is
  disk pressure; nothing else.
- **Do NOT archive recent batches (< 30 days).** Downstream
  consumers may need a replay window. 30 days is a conservative
  floor; specific consumers may need longer in practice — they are
  expected to declare that need rather than discover it through a
  missing file.
- Archived batches stay valid and parseable. A consumer that
  *chooses* to read the archive can do so; the default expectation
  is that consumers ignore the `archive/` subdirectory.
- Idempotency persists across the move — `batch_id` keys are stable.

---

## 8. Backup

The ZTN repo has a GitHub remote. Every `git push` carries the
batches directory off the local box. There is no separate
batches-only backup mechanism in A0-ZTN scope, by design — the
engine's git repo is the unit of backup.

Per ARCHITECTURE.md §8.12.5 (one specific consumer's restore plan,
in the minder-project repo), this directory doubles as a disaster-
recovery source for downstream state: with the consumer's databases
lost but ZTN intact, re-processing every `*.json` here re-derives
the typed-object state. This is a major-incident fallback, not
routine restore.

For deeper protection (account loss, mirror failure), GitHub
mirroring or an off-site git remote is the owner's responsibility
and is out of A0-ZTN scope.
