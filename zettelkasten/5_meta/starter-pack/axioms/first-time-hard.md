  When building something for the first time that you'll reuse — a

# First time hard — so it's easy forever after

## Statement

The first implementation of something reusable sets the cost of every
future use. Done properly the first time — proper interfaces, decent
observability, sensible defaults, tests where it counts — every
subsequent use is cheap. Done sloppily, every subsequent use is a tax
plus a hidden risk.

## Why hold this

Rework is the most expensive type of work. Stack-of-debt grows
geometrically; each new fix on top of an old hack is more expensive
than the previous one. Up-front investment is economically superior
even when it feels heavy in the moment.

## Edge cases — when not to apply

- True throwaway prototypes (validating a hypothesis, probing an API,
  proof-of-concept) — explicitly TTL'd. Be honest with yourself when
  "throwaway" is real vs when it's a self-justification.
- Exploratory research where scope isn't clear yet — premature
  architecture is waste. Iterate quickly, then invest once direction
  is confirmed.

## Edit me

This axiom is well-established in engineering culture; consider
keeping it. Tighten the edge cases to match your own judgement of
when "good enough fast" beats "good".
