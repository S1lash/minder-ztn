# minder-ztn — Obsidian vault seeder.
#
# Idempotently seeds Obsidian configuration for the ZTN vault. Run by
# integrations/claude-code/install.sh after Claude integration is wired,
# but also safe to run standalone.
#
# Behaviour:
#   - If <vault>/.obsidian/ does not exist, copies vault-config/ there.
#   - If <vault>/minder-ztn.md does not exist, copies the dashboard
#     template there. A legacy <vault>/HOME.md (pre-rename) is migrated
#     to minder-ztn.md preserving any owner edits.
#     Those two are the owner's once they exist: the seeder leaves them
#     alone, and only --force overwrites them.
#   - The four help docs under <vault>/5_meta/help/ are the exception,
#     because they are not the owner's: they are copies of engine docs.
#     They are DERIVED — regenerated on every run, so a hand edit in them
#     is undone by the next one, and --force is not needed to refresh
#     them. `--refresh-help` runs that step alone; sync_engine.sh calls it
#     after every update, so a changed engine doc reaches the vault
#     instead of freezing at install time.
#
# Engine improvements to vault-config flow to friends via sync_engine.sh
# (the source under integrations/obsidian/ is engine-synced); the live
# .obsidian/ in the friend's vault stays the friend's own.

# --- Help docs into the vault (DERIVED) ---
# Obsidian resolves links relative to the vault root. Engine docs live outside
# the vault (in repo `docs/` and `integrations/obsidian/`), so a curated subset
# is rendered into `<vault>/5_meta/help/` for the dashboard and bookmarks to
# link to.
#
# These four are DERIVED surfaces in the engine's own sense: copies of engine
# docs with no legitimate owner edit, regenerated on every run. They were
# previously copy-if-missing, which froze each friend's copy at the moment
# they installed — silently, since a stale doc looks exactly like a current
# one. A hand edit here is undone by the next run; that is the DERIVED rule,
# and softening it for these files would restore the freeze.

  → Browse → search by author/name above → Install + Enable

(Once installed, they auto-enable on next launch — your

File explorer cleanup is handled by the shipped CSS snippet
"ztn-hide-engine-paths" — already enabled by the seeder via
appearance.json. No plugin needed.
