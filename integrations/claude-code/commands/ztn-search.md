# /ztn:search — Search Zettelkasten

Search the personal ZTN knowledge base and return relevant content.

**Base path:** `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/`

## Query: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution

### 1. Parse Query

Interpret `$ARGUMENTS` as a natural language search query. Extract:
- **Keywords** — main search terms
- **People** — if mentioned (map to person IDs: lowercase transliterated first name)
- **Projects** — if mentioned (map to project IDs)
- **Time range** — if mentioned ("last week", "in January", etc.)
- **Type filter** — if mentioned ("meetings", "ideas", "tasks", etc.)

### 2. Search Strategy

Run searches in parallel for speed:

**a) Frontmatter search** — grep YAML fields:
```bash
# By person
grep -rl "person-id" {{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/

# By project
grep -rl "project-id" {{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/

# By tag
grep -rl "tag-pattern" {{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/
```

**b) Content search** — grep note bodies for keywords (use Grep tool, not bash grep)

**c) Registry lookup** — check registries for entity resolution:
- `_system/registries/PEOPLE.md` — resolve person names to IDs
- `_system/registries/PROJECTS.md` — resolve project names to IDs
- `_system/registries/TAGS.md` — find relevant tags

**d) Tasks/Calendar** — if query is about tasks or events:
- `_system/TASKS.md` — search open tasks
- `_system/CALENDAR.md` — search events

### 3. Filter & Rank

- If time range specified: filter by `created:` date in frontmatter
- If type specified: filter by `types:` in frontmatter
- Rank by relevance: exact keyword match > tag match > content mention
- Limit to **top 5-10 most relevant notes**

### 4. Return Results

For each relevant note, show:
- **File path** (relative to zettelkasten/)
- **Title** and **date**
- **Relevant excerpt** — the paragraph or section that matches the query
- **Tags** — for context

If the user asked a question (not just "find X"), also provide a **synthesis** — combine information from multiple notes into a coherent answer.
