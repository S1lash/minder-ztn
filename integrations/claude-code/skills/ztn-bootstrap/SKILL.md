# /ztn:bootstrap — One-Shot Populator

Disposable one-shot populator for ZTN system files on an existing base.

**Cross-skill:** bootstrap is NOT in the `process/maintain/lint` lock matrix. User
ensures no other skill is running before invocation. Bootstrap writes `log_maintenance.md`;
operationally this runs once at system init (or disaster recovery / friend onboarding),
so race with concurrent skills is not an operational concern.

**Philosophy:** Never decide silently. At any confidence gap — log a question to
`_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` (HARD RULE from SYSTEM_CONFIG.md) and use a conservative default.

**Disposable:** after the first run, incremental upkeep is `/ztn:maintain` (after each batch)
and `/ztn:lint` (nightly). Keep this skill for:
- Onboarding a friend (their ZTN with imported records)
- Disaster recovery if system files are corrupted
- Major refactor (structure changes → recompute from scratch)

**Documentation convention:** при любых edits этого SKILL соблюдай `_system/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — файл описывает current behavior без version/phase/rename-history narratives.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` supports:
- `--dry-run` — report what would be done, write nothing
- `--skip-people` — keep existing PEOPLE.md tier/mentions untouched
- `--skip-threads` — skip OPEN_THREADS detection
- `--skip-soul` — do not regenerate SOUL.md draft (assume user filled it)
- `--skip-raw-scan` — skip raw transcript scan of `_sources/inbox/` + `_sources/processed/` (see Step 1.5). Disables ALL four signal classes.
- `--skip-projects` — skip Step 3.5 PROJECTS.md seeding (people / hubs / principle candidates still run)
- `--skip-hub-candidates` — skip Step 4.5 hub-candidate clustering
- `--skip-principles` — skip Step 1.5 signal 4 (do not append to principle-candidates.jsonl)
- `--raw-scan-only` — force a raw-only scan even when structured signal exists (friend onboarding, disaster recovery)
- `--threads-window <N>` — weeks to scan for active threads (default: 6)
- `--with-starter-axioms` — opt-in: copy generic starter axioms from
  `5_meta/starter-pack/axioms/` into `0_constitution/axiom/{domain}/`
  as drafts. Default OFF — friend's constitution should grow from
  their own captured candidates, not from inherited principles. See
  Step 2.5 below

---

## Operating Modes

Bootstrap auto-detects its mode based on current ZTN state. No mode flag needed
unless user forces via `--raw-scan-only` or `--skip-raw-scan`.

| Mode | Trigger | Primary signal | Raw scan role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Established** | `_records/` + PARA have files with rich `people:` frontmatter | Structured frontmatter (authoritative counts) | Catch-up: flag new names in inbox/processed not yet in registry (CLARIFICATIONS) |
| **Fresh onboarding** | No records, no knowledge notes, only transcripts in `_sources/inbox/` | Raw transcript text (LLM extraction) | Primary — everything comes from raw scan + user's profile file if any |
| **Mixed** | Both structured notes AND pending inbox transcripts | Structured (primary) + raw (secondary) | Incremental: add new people from inbox to CLARIFICATIONS before first `/ztn:process` |

**Fresh-clone onboarding use case (explicit):** new user clones the
skeleton, optionally drops transcripts into `_sources/inbox/`, then runs
`/ztn:bootstrap` BEFORE any `/ztn:process`. Skill conducts the SOUL
interview (Step 2 primary path), seeds PEOPLE/OPEN_THREADS drafts from
raw content (if any). User reviews CLARIFICATIONS, then runs
`/ztn:process` for first real batch.

---

## Preconditions

Before running, verify:

1. `_system/docs/batch-format.md` exists → если нет, abort — базовая структура ZTN не инициализирована
2. `_system/SOUL.md`, `OPEN_THREADS.md`, `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`, `log_maintenance.md`, `BATCH_LOG.md`, `batches/` existence
3. `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` exists и writable
4. `3_resources/people/PEOPLE.md` существует — skilll модифицирует его, не создаёт

---

## Step 0: Pre-flight checks (fresh-clone orchestration)

This skill is the **canonical orchestrator** for first-time onboarding
on a fresh skeleton clone. The user did `install.sh` + invoked
`/ztn:bootstrap` — everything else is on the skill. Before any work,
detect missing inputs and ask the user inline how to proceed. Do NOT
silently start scanning when key inputs look absent — the user almost
certainly meant to provide them.

Run these checks in order. Each check that fails → ask the user once,
record the answer, continue. Multiple failures → batch them into ONE
question with numbered options when possible.

### 0.1 Mode detection

Run mode detection from Step 1 first. The pre-flight prompts below
adapt based on whether mode is `established`, `mixed`, or
`fresh-onboarding`. On `established` mode skip 0.2–0.4 (the user is
not in first-time onboarding).

### 0.2 Transcript backlog check (fresh / mixed only)

Glob `_sources/inbox/**/*.md` and `_sources/processed/**/*.md`. If
total transcript count < 5 AND mode is `fresh-onboarding`:

> **Found {N} transcripts in your sources.** Bootstrap's signal
> extraction (people, projects, hubs, principles) needs raw material —
> below ~10 transcripts the registries will be near-empty. Choose:
>
> 1. **Pause now.** Drop your backlog (voice-recorder transcripts,
>    journal exports, past notes) into the matching `_sources/inbox/{id}/`
>    folder for each active source declared in `_system/registries/SOURCES.md`,
>    then re-invoke `/ztn:bootstrap`. If you need a source that does not
>    exist yet, run `/ztn:source-add` first.
> 2. **Proceed anyway** — identity-only path. Useful if you genuinely
>    have no backlog and want to start fresh from `/ztn:capture-candidate`
>    + future `/ztn:process` runs.
> 3. **Cancel.**

Record the choice in log_maintenance.md.

### 0.3 Profile check (fresh / mixed only)

Read `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/*.md` (recursive) and
`_sources/processed/crafted/describe-me/*.md`. Apply the
template-default detection from Step 2.1. If no non-template profile
file found:

> **No describe-me profile found.** Bootstrap can either:
>
> 1. **Pause** so you can fill
>    `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/PROFILE.template.md`
>    (or paste an AI-generated draft per the template's prompt). Re-
>    invoke when ready. This is the highest-quality path — the profile
>    is the primary source for SOUL.md.
> 2. **Run a short interview now** — I'll ask 3–5 questions to seed
>    SOUL.md Identity / Values / Working Style. Faster but lower
>    fidelity than a written profile.
> 3. **Skip identity** — proceed with a minimal `Name: <unset>` SOUL
>    and let it accrete over time via `/ztn:lint` and manual edits.

Record the choice. If (1), abort the skill cleanly; do NOT partially
run.

### 0.4 Install sanity (any mode)

Verify `~/.claude/skills/ztn-bootstrap/` (or wherever the user's
`CLAUDE_HOME` points) symlink resolves into THIS repo. If the skill is
loaded from a different path (e.g. another instance), surface a
warning:

> **Install path mismatch.** The skill is loaded from `{path}` but
> this repo is at `{repo}`. If you have multiple ZTN instances, this
> may cause writes to land in the wrong tree. Re-run
> `./integrations/claude-code/install.sh` from this repo, then re-
> invoke. Continue anyway? (y/n)

This catches the common «cloned a new instance, forgot to re-install»
mistake.

### 0.5 Skill collision (any mode)

Check `_sources/.processing.lock`, `_sources/.maintain.lock`,
`_sources/.lint.lock`. Bootstrap is not in the cross-skill lock
matrix, but a stale lock from a prior run is a strong signal that
another skill crashed mid-flight. If found > 2 hours old, surface:

> **Stale lock found:** `_sources/.{maintain,lint,process}.lock`
> ({age}). A previous skill run may have crashed. Inspect and
> consider deleting before continuing.

### 0.6 Pre-flight summary + doctrine transmission

After all checks pass / are answered, surface a one-screen frame +
plan to the owner. The frame block is the **doctrine transmission** —
the only moment where the owner explicitly sees what their system
operates by. Skip ONLY in `established` mode (owner already runs
this — re-stating the frame is noise).

For `fresh-onboarding` and `mixed` modes:

> **The frame your system runs by**
>
> ZTN is your second consciousness — not an archive, not a TODO list.
> Three layers store knowledge: records (what happened), knowledge
> notes (what it means), hubs (how understanding evolves). A fourth
> layer — your constitution — governs how skills reason on your behalf.
>
> Eight processing principles guide every judgement: capture first
> (filter never), weight by structure (don't discard), look for
> connections (causal / evolutionary / structural), cross domain
> boundaries (where the highest-value insights live), accumulate
> (don't deduplicate), capture both action and knowledge, capture
> every deliberate person mention, preserve texture and narrative.
>
> Three rules every skill enforces: **surface, don't decide silently**
> (CLARIFICATIONS over guesses); **inclusion bias on capture, curation
> on promotion** (cheap to add, expensive to canonise); **idempotency**
> (re-runs add or surface, never overwrite your edits).
>
> Long-form: `_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` (auto-loaded in every
> session via `~/.claude/rules/ztn-engine-doctrine.md`). The frame
> persists from this point — every future `/ztn:process`, `/ztn:lint`,
> `/ztn:maintain` operates against it.
>

## Pipeline

### Step 1: Load Context

Read for context (read-only). Doctrine sources first — these calibrate
every judgement made later in the pipeline.

**Doctrine (load FIRST, before any data):**

- `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` — engine
  operating philosophy. **Authority is binding** — every Step in this
  skill operates against this frame. If a Step's behaviour appears to
  conflict with doctrine, raise a `process-compatibility` CLARIFICATION
  rather than diverging.
- `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/PROCESSING_PRINCIPLES.md` — 8 principles
  + values-profile calibration. Bootstrap is the FIRST run on a fresh
  instance; read full principles even though SOUL.md may not yet
  override the defaults.
- `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` — system contract
  (canonical rules; no version check — file IS the contract per
  CONVENTIONS.md).
- `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — documentation
  style (binding on every edit this skill makes to engine docs / SKILLs).
- `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/0_constitution/CONSTITUTION.md` — constitution
  protocol (used by Step 1.5 signal 4 + Step 2.5 starter axioms +
  principle-candidates schema).

**Owner state:**

- Owner profile sources (see Step 2 priority order): describe-me
  PROFILE.md is primary; bootstrap interview is fallback;
  `_sources/inbox/` profile files are secondary; `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  is advisory only (may belong to a different instance).
- `3_resources/people/PEOPLE.md` — existing people registry (may be
  empty or template-only on fresh onboarding)
- `_system/TASKS.md`, `_system/CALENDAR.md` — current active
  tasks/events (optional)
- `3_resources/people/*.md` — existing profiles (auto-Tier-1
  regardless of mentions)

Glob for structured signal:
- `_records/meetings/*.md` + `_records/observations/*.md` — record files (both kinds)
- PARA trees (`1_projects/`, `2_areas/`, `3_resources/`, `4_archive/`) — knowledge notes

Glob for raw signal (used in Step 1.5):
- `_sources/inbox/**/*.md` — unprocessed sources (every active source declared in `_system/registries/SOURCES.md`)
- `_sources/processed/**/*.md` — already processed sources (for catch-up scan)

Bootstrap is source-agnostic: it does not name individual source IDs. Whatever
rows are present in SOURCES.md determine the scan surface. The only path
bootstrap treats specially is the one declared as `Skip Subdirs` on the
`crafted` row (or any row that uses the same mechanism for reference content),
which is read in Step 2 as the SOUL profile source and is moved from inbox
to processed mirror after consumption.

**Mode detection:**

```
if count(structured notes) == 0 AND count(transcripts) > 0:
    mode = "fresh-onboarding"
elif count(structured notes) > 0 AND count(unprocessed inbox files) > 0:
    mode = "mixed"
else:
    mode = "established"
```

Record mode in log_maintenance.md entry for auditability.

### Step 1.5: Raw transcript scan (inbox + processed) — multi-signal

Skip if `--skip-raw-scan`. Force-only if `--raw-scan-only` (then skip structured glob above).

The raw scan extracts FOUR signal classes from the corpus, not just people.
On a fresh skeleton clone with 50–500 dropped transcripts this is the
high-leverage step — every signal seeded here saves friction during the
first `/ztn:process` batch.

#### Scaling — partition + parallel subagents

A single LLM pass over 100+ transcripts produces low-quality extraction
(attention drift, missed entities, hallucinated clusters) regardless of
context-window size. Partition the raw corpus before dispatching:

- **Chunk algorithm.** Sort transcripts chronologically (oldest first).
  Pack into chunks until either:
  - cumulative input tokens ≥ **200 000** (orchestrator briefing
    overhead headroom on top), OR
  - chunk size ≥ **15 transcripts**
  whichever fires first. Under-filled chunks acceptable. Single-file
  oversize → solo chunk.
- **Dispatch.** One subagent per chunk via parallel `Task` blocks,
  **max 3 concurrent** (matches `/ztn:process` Step 3.0.2). Queue the
  rest FIFO. Each subagent extracts all 4 signal classes from its
  chunk and returns a structured signal report.
- **Aggregation (orchestrator).** After all subagents return:
  - **People** — union by candidate id; sum mention counts; merge
    ambiguity flags (any subagent flagging ambiguity wins).
  - **Projects** — union by candidate id; sum mention counts; collect
    supporting transcript paths.
  - **Hub candidates** — global topic-cluster pass over all returned
    cluster candidates: clusters appearing in ≥ 2 subagent reports
    merge by slug; clusters from a single subagent stay if their
    support already crosses the 3-transcripts / 14-days threshold.
    Cap final list at top-15 by support.
  - **Principle candidates** — append all returned candidates to
    `principle-candidates.jsonl`; dedup against last 30 days of buffer
    by `(situation, observation, hypothesis)` triple.

**Why not single-pass even with 1M-context Opus.** Context-window size
is not a quality guarantee. LLM extraction quality on a corpus of 100+
heterogeneous transcripts drops sharply when held in one attention
span — we trade fewer LLM calls for measurably worse signal. Subagent
partitioning is the standard ZTN pattern (`/ztn:process` Step 3.0.2)
for the same reason.

**Time / cost note.** A 100-transcript onboarding scan on Opus typically
runs in ~7 chunks × ~3 minutes wall-clock = 10–15 minutes if 3-wave
parallelism holds, plus aggregation. Friend should expect this and not
abort early. Bootstrap surface a progress line per dispatched wave.

For each transcript in the raw globs above:

1. **People (signal 1).**
   - Extract mentioned names — scan body text for proper nouns (any
     language; expect mixed Cyrillic / Latin / etc.), patterns like
     «Вася», «Петя сказал», «встретились с @imya». Use LLM for
     disambiguation — regex alone won't catch conjugated forms.
   - Normalize to candidate IDs per `registries/PEOPLE.md` ID Generation
     Rules (`firstname-lastname`, lowercase, dash, transliteration). If
     only first name found — candidate is ambiguous.
   - Match against existing registry: exact match → increment raw-scan
     mention count; ambiguous → CLARIFICATION; no match → CLARIFICATION
     ("Found name '{form}' in {file}. Add to PEOPLE.md as new person?").
   - Track raw dates — transcript timestamp feeds `last_mention`.

2. **Project candidates (signal 2).**
   - Extract recurring named initiatives / codenames / product names
     across transcripts: capitalised noun phrases, project codenames
     repeated across ≥ 2 distinct transcripts, explicit phrases like
     «проект X», «инициатива Y».
   - Normalize to kebab-case candidate id.
   - **Cross-check with PROJECTS.md / `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/`
     PROFILE.md projects table** — if friend pre-declared a project, raw
     scan matches and increments mention count rather than creating a
     duplicate candidate.
   - Output: list of `(candidate-id, name-form, mention-count, first-seen, last-seen)`
     for Step 3.5.

3. **Hub candidates (signal 3).**
   - Cluster transcripts by topic using LLM topic extraction. A topic
     becomes a hub-candidate when it appears in **≥ 3 distinct transcripts**
     across **≥ 14 days** (matching the `/ztn:process` Step 3.5 hub
     creation threshold; raw scan does NOT create hub files — that
     remains `/ztn:process` territory once knowledge notes exist).
   - Output: list of `(candidate-slug, supporting-transcripts, span,
     1-line-rationale)` for Step 4.5.
   - **Cap at top-15 by support** to keep the review queue manageable.

4. **Principle candidates (signal 4).**
   - Detect explicit principle moments per
     `~/.claude/rules/constitution-capture.md` triggers (a–d): explicit
     behavioural principle stated with reason; conscious trade-off; non-obvious
     ethical / interpersonal judgement; clear implicit pattern with
     hypothesis. Conservative — better to miss 30% than ingest 300% noise.
   - **Derivation invariant.** Every candidate must derive from a specific
     transcript moment. Do not synthesize candidates from prior knowledge
     of how mature constitutions look or from `/ztn:capture-candidate`'s
     calibration examples — those examples illustrate form, not content.
     If a transcript chunk yields zero qualifying moments, the correct
     output is zero candidates, not "plausible defaults".
   - Apply the same well-formedness rules and boundary cases listed in
     `/ztn:capture-candidate` SKILL — the field constraints
     (concrete `situation`, verbatim-or-empty `observation`, hypothesis
     with reasoning, `unknown` over forced guess, no proper nouns) hold
     identically here.
   - For each match append a single record to
     `_system/state/principle-candidates.jsonl` with fields per
     `/ztn:capture-candidate` schema PLUS `origin: bootstrap-raw-scan`
     and `session_id: bootstrap-{YYYY-MM-DD}`. Buffer is append-only —
     `/ztn:lint` F.3 weekly review picks them up. Bootstrap-origin
     candidates never qualify for F.5 LLM auto-merge (mirrors
     `origin: work` guard in lint F.5).

#### Scope tagging (work / personal axis)

ZTN handles the work / personal axis as a first-class universal
property of every owner — see `ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` §1.5. Every
extracted signal gets a **scope hint** during raw scan, so downstream
seeding (PEOPLE.md Org column, PROJECTS.md Scope column, principle
domain tagging) honours the split without owner having to retag
afterwards.

For each transcript determine a **source-scope bias** before extraction.
The bias comes from two declarative inputs — never from hardcoded source
IDs in this SKILL:

1. **Layer signal** (from path):
   - `_records/meetings/` (and its processed mirror) → bias `work`
   - `_records/observations/` (and its processed mirror) → bias `personal`
2. **Source signal** (from `Default Domain` column on the matching
   row of `_system/registries/SOURCES.md`):
   - `personal` / `work` → use directly as the bias
   - `mixed` → infer per-transcript content (LLM scope classification:
     «is the dominant topic about employer / clients / professional
     team OR life / relationships / health / personal projects?»)
   - `auto` → same as `mixed` — let the LLM decide per-file

If a row carries `Skip Subdirs`, those subdirectories are out of scope
entirely (they are reference material, consumed via a different contract
in Step 2).

Apply the bias to each extracted signal:

- **Person** — if scope-bias is `work` AND person resolves to a
  candidate with hints of organisational role → suggest `Org` value
  for PEOPLE.md row. If scope-bias is `personal` AND no org clue →
  leave `Org` empty (personal-context relation per PEOPLE.md
  Org-as-scope convention).
- **Project candidate** — emit a `scope_hint` field ∈ {`work`,
  `personal`, `side`, `mixed`} based on transcript bias + content.
  Step 3.5 writes this to PROJECTS.md `Scope` column.
- **Hub candidate** — emit a `domains` array (work / personal-richer
  tags like `identity`, `relationships`, `learning`); Step 4.5
  surfaces this in CLARIFICATIONS so future `/ztn:process` Step 3.5
  hub creation inherits.
- **Principle candidate** — set `suggested_domain` from the
  constitution vocabulary (`identity` / `ethics` / `work` / `tech` /
  `relationships` / `health` / `money` / `time` / `learning` /
  `ai-interaction` / `meta`). NEVER use `personal` as a domain (per
  ENGINE_DOCTRINE §1.5 — too vague). For personal-bias transcripts,
  prefer `identity` / `ethics` / `relationships` / `learning` based
  on principle content.

Cross-domain signals (work delegation through a therapy lens; career
decision affecting personal life) produce signals in BOTH scopes —
Principle 4 (Cross-Domain Permeability) at the bootstrap level.

**Dual-source reconciliation for established/mixed modes:**

- Authoritative count = structured frontmatter (Step 3 below)
- Raw count is advisory — used only to surface gaps (person in transcripts but not in registry)
- Raw count never overrides structured; instead it triggers CLARIFICATIONS

**Fresh-onboarding mode:**

- Raw count becomes the primary mention count for all four signal classes
- All discovered names go through CLARIFICATIONS first (never auto-added to PEOPLE.md)
- Skill produces a "seed PEOPLE.md" draft with candidates flagged for user review
- Project candidates seed PROJECTS.md as `status: candidate` rows with `Scope` filled from `scope_hint` (Step 3.5)
- Hub and principle candidates surface as CLARIFICATIONS / jsonl appends only — no file creation

### Step 2: SOUL.md draft

Source priority for Identity / Values / Working Style / Active Goals.
SOUL.md is the canonical owner-profile source; the user's global
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is advisory only.

1. **Crafted profile in `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/`** (primary
   when present and non-template).

   **File discovery.** Read every `*.md` in the directory (recursive).
   Multiple files are allowed — owner's instance has examples like
   `1 - personal_profile-claude.md`, `2 - personal_profile-gpt.md`. When
   multiple non-template files are found, **merge** by section: for each
   SOUL.md section, prefer the longer non-placeholder body across files
   and surface a CLARIFICATION listing the alternates so the owner can
   pick a different version. Do not concatenate sections silently.

   **Template-default detection** (per file). Count placeholder markers
   matching the regex `\{[A-Z][^{}]{4,}\}` (curly-brace placeholders
   shipped in `PROFILE.template.md`). If ≥ 60% of the file's bracketed
   spans are still unchanged, treat the file as template and skip it
   (write CLARIFICATION «Profile draft detected but mostly placeholders
   — consider editing or deleting»). This handles three failure modes:
   (a) friend opens template, edits nothing, runs bootstrap — caught;
   (b) friend edits one or two fields and forgets — surfaced not
   silently consumed; (c) friend deletes some placeholders but leaves
   the rest as TODO markers — counts edited fraction, partial profiles
   still flow through.

   **Section parsing.** Pull section-by-section into SOUL.md draft.
   Sections whose body is still a placeholder span surface as items in
   CLARIFICATIONS `### Profile gaps` instead of triggering interview
   questions (placeholders are an explicit «I'll fill this later»
   signal — interview only fires when the section is *missing*, not
   *unfilled*).

   **Auxiliary tables in profile** feed downstream steps:
   - `### People who matter` table → Step 3 PEOPLE.md (rows with
     placeholder ids like `{ivan-petrov}` are dropped, not seeded)
   - `### Projects you care about` table → Step 3.5 PROJECTS.md
     (same placeholder-row drop)
   - `### Principles you live by` bullets → Step 1.5 signal 4
     (each bullet becomes a `principle-candidates.jsonl` entry with
     `origin: bootstrap-profile` and `session_id: bootstrap-{date}`)

   **After read:** move the entire `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/`
   directory to `_sources/processed/crafted/describe-me/` so
   `/ztn:process` doesn't re-process the profile as a knowledge note.
   The maintainer's existing layout uses processed-side describe-me as
   reference; this matches. If `_sources/processed/crafted/describe-me/`
   already has files (re-run, or owner's pre-existing reference set),
   merge directories — never overwrite existing files; collisions
   surface as CLARIFICATIONS.

2. **Bootstrap interview** (primary fallback when (1) is absent or
   template-default, or to fill gaps left by (1)). Ask 3-5 short
   questions targeting only the *missing* SOUL sections: name (used
   as `## Identity` `Name:`), role, current focus, values, working
   style. Write answers directly into SOUL.md.

3. **Other profile files in `_sources/`** (secondary) — any file in
   `_sources/inbox/` or `_sources/processed/` (outside `describe-me/`)
   whose filename contains `bio`, `profile`, `about-me`, `describe-me`
   (case-insensitive). Pull verbatim into a CLARIFICATION asking user
   whether to merge into SOUL.md (not auto-merged — too risky, format
   unknown).

4. **`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (advisory only) — may belong to a
   different instance (work vs personal) or to no instance yet. Use
   only when (1)–(3) yield nothing AND the file clearly identifies
   the same person. Never silently authoritative — always confirm
   with user before copying values into SOUL.md.

5. **Fallback** — if all four are empty / inconclusive: draft minimal
   Identity (`Name: <unset>`) + CLARIFICATION asking user to fill the
   profile manually.

Focus signals:

- **Established/mixed:** derive Primary/Secondary/Personal from top streams in TASKS.md +
  density of last 30-50 records
- **Fresh onboarding:** derive from transcripts in `_sources/` (inbox + processed) — if the
  user dumped 10 transcripts all about "finding new job", that's a signal

Field confidence:

- **Identity** (high) — directly from profile
- **Values** (high) — from profile Values section if present, else CLARIFICATION
- **Current Focus** (medium) — from streams/transcripts. If ≥ 5 distinct themes active — CLARIFICATION
- **Active Goals** (low) — pull explicit deadlines/commitments. Leave empty if unclear
- **Working Style, Context for Agents** — always `<!-- TODO -->` markers (never derivable automatically)

Skip regeneration if `--skip-soul` — append note to log_maintenance.md and leave file untouched.

### Step 2.5: Constitution starter pack (opt-in)

Skipped unless `--with-starter-axioms` is set. Off by default — fresh
clones should grow their constitution from `/ztn:capture-candidate`
observations, not from inherited principles.

When the flag is on:

1. Read every `*.md` under `5_meta/starter-pack/axioms/`.
2. For each file, derive destination path
   `0_constitution/axiom/{domain}/{filename}` from the file's `domain:`
   frontmatter field (e.g. `ethics`, `identity`, `work`).
3. **Skip if destination already exists** — never overwrite an axiom
   the user has already authored or edited.
4. Copy verbatim. Files keep `confidence: starter` and `status: draft`,
   so they appear in the constitution but do NOT auto-load into
   `constitution-core` (that view filters on `confidence: proven`
   `status: active`).
5. Append a single CLARIFICATION grouping copied filenames with the
   action: "Review each starter axiom — keep, edit, or delete; mark
   as `confidence: proven` `status: active` to promote into core."

The flag does nothing on second/third runs (idempotent — destinations
already exist after first run, all are skipped).

### Step 3: PEOPLE.md tier + mention counting

Process depends on mode:

**Established / Mixed modes (primary = structured frontmatter):**

For every person already in `PEOPLE.md`:

1. **Count structured mentions** across:
   - `_records/meetings/*.md` + `_records/observations/*.md` frontmatter `people:` (and `speaker:` for observations) arrays
   - PARA knowledge notes frontmatter `people:` arrays
   - Dedup rule: ONE mention per file (person appearing 6 times in one transcript = 1, not 6).
     Canonical rule per `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` Data & Processing Rules — mention counting is 1-per-file
2. **Capture `last_mention`** — latest `created` date across files referencing the person
3. **Cross-check with raw scan (Step 1.5 output):**
   - If person appears in raw transcripts but 0 structured mentions → CLARIFICATION
     ("mentioned in N transcripts, not yet in any record/note — expected?")
   - If raw scan found new name not in registry → CLARIFICATION
     ("found '{Russian form}' in {file}. Add to PEOPLE.md as `{candidate-id}`?")
4. **Assign tier:**
   - **Tier 1** — profile in `3_resources/people/{id}.md` (auto) OR mentions ≥ 8
   - **Tier 2** — mentions 3-7
   - **Tier 3** — mentions 1-2
5. **Update PEOPLE.md schema:** add columns `Tier`, `Mentions`, `Last`. Idempotent — recompute on each run

**Fresh onboarding mode (primary = raw scan):**

1. PEOPLE.md starts empty or template-only
2. Raw scan from Step 1.5 found candidate names with `(russian form → candidate id → transcript count)`
3. **Do NOT auto-populate PEOPLE.md.** Instead write ALL candidates to CLARIFICATIONS under
   `### Suggested people from raw scan` with structure:
   ```
   - "Иван Петров" → candidate id `ivan-petrov` — mentioned in 3 transcripts, org: unknown, role: unknown
   ```
4. User reviews CLARIFICATIONS, approves/edits/rejects each. Re-run bootstrap or `/ztn:process`
   will then register approved entries

**CLARIFICATIONS triggers (all modes):**

- Same-name collision: bare first name matches multiple registered (`Даша` → `dasha-kuznetsova` vs `dasha-zaytseva`) → CLARIFICATION per occurrence
- Person with 0 mentions but has profile (stale?) → CLARIFICATION: "Still relevant? Archive?"
- Person with 8+ mentions but NO profile → CLARIFICATION: "Generate profile?" (actual creation is `/ztn:lint`)
- Raw scan finds name not resolved to any registered ID → CLARIFICATION (see above)

### Step 3.5: PROJECTS.md seeding (raw scan only)

Skip if `--skip-raw-scan` or no project candidates found in Step 1.5
signal 2. Skipped silently in `established` mode unless the raw scan
discovered a project not yet in PROJECTS.md (then surface as
CLARIFICATION, do not auto-add).

**Fresh-onboarding mode (PROJECTS.md is template-default):**

1. Take project candidates from Step 1.5 signal 2 (deduped against the
   `### Projects you care about` profile table if present — when
   profile pre-declared a project with explicit `Scope`, use that;
   otherwise use raw-scan `scope_hint`).
2. For each candidate write a row to PROJECTS.md `Active Projects`
   table with columns: `ID | Name | Description | Folder | Scope |
   Status`. `Scope` ∈ {`work`, `personal`, `side`, `mixed`} from
   profile / scope_hint. `Status: candidate`. Do NOT pick
   `### Completed Projects` automatically — staleness goes through
   CLARIFICATIONS.
3. Append a CLARIFICATIONS subsection `### Suggested projects from raw
   scan` listing each row (with Scope) + supporting transcripts +
   suggested action (`promote-active` | `merge-with-existing` |
   `correct-scope` | `dismiss`).

**Idempotency:** re-running matches by candidate id. Existing rows are
never overwritten — bootstrap only ADDS new candidate rows the first
time it sees them, then surfaces them as CLARIFICATIONS.

### Step 4: OPEN_THREADS.md detection

Source depends on mode:

- **Established / mixed:** scan `_records/meetings/*.md` + `_records/observations/*.md` + TASKS.md Waiting section from last `--threads-window` weeks (default 6). TASKS.md Waiting items cluster into strategic threads (grain: one thread covers multiple child tasks). Observation records can carry open threads too (planning sessions, therapy follow-ups).
- **Fresh onboarding:** scan raw transcripts in `_sources/inbox/` + `_sources/processed/` from last `--threads-window` weeks (or all, if less). Grain stays the same — strategic threads, not per-utterance.

Signal extraction (all modes):

1. Unresolved action items without `deadline` or phrasing like "ждём / жду от / нужно решить / нужно дождаться / уточнить у / неясно"
2. Open questions (`## Открытые вопросы`, `## Нерешённое`) in structured records
3. For raw transcripts: LLM extraction of "what's the owner waiting on, from whom, since when"

For each candidate:

1. Grep subsequent records/transcripts for closure signals: resolution, follow-up, decision
2. **If clear closure** — move to Resolved section with resolution + source
3. **If still open** — add to Active with status (waiting-for-response / needs-decision / needs-research / blocked), source, people involved, 1-2 line context
4. **If unclear** — CLARIFICATION: "Thread <slug> — still open? last signal <date>"

Thread ID: `thread-YYYYMMDD-{semantic-slug}` where YYYYMMDD = origin date.

**Grain rule (strategic, not operational):**
One OPEN_THREADS entry should cover an umbrella topic (e.g. "Restructuring & Career") with
multiple cross-referenced TASKS.md Waiting items underneath. Do NOT create 1 thread per Waiting
task — that would duplicate TASKS.md at another grain. When in doubt — CLARIFICATION asking
user to confirm grain level.

Idempotency: re-running matches by thread-id. Existing Active threads stay unless closure detected. Resolved entries never re-open.

### Step 4.5: Hub candidates from raw scan

Skip if `--skip-raw-scan` or no hub candidates from Step 1.5 signal 3.

Bootstrap does **NOT** create hub files. Hub files require ≥ 3 atomic
knowledge notes per `/ztn:process` Step 3.5 — those notes don't exist
yet on a fresh clone. Instead:

1. For each hub candidate (capped at top-15 by support), append a
   CLARIFICATION under `### Suggested hubs from raw scan` with:
   - candidate slug
   - 1-line rationale (what the cluster is about)
   - supporting transcripts (≤ 5 paths, sorted by date)
   - suggested action: `seed-hub-after-first-process` (default) or
     `dismiss` (false-positive cluster)
2. After the friend's first `/ztn:process` batch produces knowledge
   notes that hit the threshold, `/ztn:process` Step 3.5 will create
   the corresponding hub naturally. The CLARIFICATION serves as a
   review log — friend can compare bootstrap's expectation vs reality
   and dismiss noise early.

**Why not lower the hub-creation threshold for fresh onboarding.** A
hub created with 0 supporting knowledge notes is a stub; the «3+ notes»
threshold encodes a real signal-to-noise floor. Pre-seeding the
candidate list captures bootstrap's macro view without weakening the
floor.

### Step 4.7: Principle-candidate harvest

Already executed inline as part of Step 1.5 signal 4. Step 4.7 only
counts and reports for log_maintenance.md (number appended to jsonl,
breakdown by `suggested_type`, breakdown by `suggested_domain`).

### Step 5: CURRENT_CONTEXT.md generation

Compose snapshot from updated SOUL + OPEN_THREADS + TASKS + CALENDAR:

- **Focus** — copy SOUL.md Primary focus
- **Tasks Due Today/Tomorrow** — filter TASKS.md by deadline
- **Meetings Today** — filter CALENDAR.md Upcoming by date = today
- **Open Threads** — count + top 3 by recency from OPEN_THREADS.md
- **Last Activity** — `(no batches yet)` since bootstrap predates any `/ztn:process` run

Frontmatter: `generated_by: ztn:bootstrap`, `batch_id: bootstrap`, `generated: {now ISO 8601}`.

### Step 6: log_maintenance.md entry

Append to `_system/state/log_maintenance.md` (newest first, below the `<!-- Entries append BELOW -->` marker):

```markdown
## {ISO 8601 UTC} | bootstrap | by: ztn:bootstrap | batch: —

### Updates
- SOUL.md drafted (Identity + Values high confidence, Focus medium, Working Style + Context for Agents — TODO markers)
- PEOPLE.md: {N} entries updated (tiers assigned, mentions recomputed, last_mention added)
  - Tier 1: {N} | Tier 2: {N} | Tier 3: {N}
- OPEN_THREADS.md: {N} active, {M} resolved
- CURRENT_CONTEXT.md: generated

### Auto-Fixes
- {anything auto-corrected — normally empty for bootstrap}

### Suggestions → CLARIFICATIONS
- {count} questions raised (see _system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md under header 'bootstrap YYYY-MM-DD')

### Errors / Warnings
- {none | warning text}
```

### Step 7: CLARIFICATIONS grouping

Все вопросы от bootstrap — inline в `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` под заголовком
`## bootstrap YYYY-MM-DD`. Один файл, унифицированный подход для всех скиллов.

Внутри секции группировка по типу для читаемости:
- `### Tier / mention rules`
- `### Thread closures`
- `### Focus / SOUL ambiguities`
- `### People identity / same-name collisions`
- `### Suggested people from raw scan` (fresh/mixed — candidate IDs для утверждения)
- `### Suggested projects from raw scan` (fresh/mixed — candidate project rows added to PROJECTS.md)
- `### Suggested hubs from raw scan` (fresh — topic clusters; no hub files created until first /ztn:process meets 3-note threshold)
- `### Profile gaps` (sections in describe-me/PROFILE.md still on placeholder defaults)

Volume не ограничиваем. Если реально будет 100+ — revisit дизайн, но до этого
единый файл лучше чем два (consistency > size optimization).

### Step 8: Report

Output to user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 ZTN BOOTSTRAP COMPLETE ✓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Mode:           {established | fresh-onboarding | mixed}
Profile seed:   {used: describe-me/PROFILE.md | used: bootstrap interview | none}
Raw scan:       {N} transcripts in inbox + {M} in processed
Structured:     {R} records + {K} knowledge notes scanned

SOUL.md           drafted — review Working Style + Context for Agents sections
PEOPLE.md         {N} persons (structured) + {N_raw} raw-scan candidates → CLARIFICATIONS
  Tier 1: {N}  | Tier 2: {N}  | Tier 3: {N}
PROJECTS.md       {N_proj} candidate rows added → CLARIFICATIONS
Hub candidates    {N_hub} clusters surfaced → CLARIFICATIONS (no files created)
Principle cand.   {N_princ} appended to principle-candidates.jsonl (review via /ztn:lint F.3)
OPEN_THREADS      {N} active | {M} resolved
CURRENT_CONTEXT   generated ({no batches yet | last batch: X})
log_maintenance.md bootstrap entry appended

Next steps (in order — do not skip):

1. **Run `/ztn:resolve-clarifications`** — {K} questions accumulated,
   grouped by subsection (people / projects / hubs / threads / focus
   / profile gaps). The skill walks them by theme one round at a time
   with full context inline, applies confirmed resolutions, and
   archives closed items. 5–30 minutes depending on corpus size.

2. **Finalise `_system/SOUL.md`** — fill any Working Style / Context
   for Agents gaps the profile or interview left as TODO markers.

3. **Run `/ztn:process`** — backfill the inbox into records, knowledge
   notes, and hubs.
   - Process partitions automatically: N=6 transcripts or 250 000
     tokens per batch, max 3 parallel subagents per wave.
   - `/ztn:maintain` runs as after-batch integrator inside the same
     flow — DO NOT invoke it manually between batches.
   - For 50–200 transcripts expect 30 min – 2 h wall-clock, 8–35
     batches across 3–12 waves.
   - Hubs that bootstrap surfaced as candidates materialise as actual
     hub files when knowledge-note threshold (3+) is met mid-backfill.

4. **DO NOT run `/ztn:lint` between batches.** Lint is the nightly
   slop-catcher; on a fresh backfill the same items re-surface batch
   after batch and resolve themselves as later batches land. Run lint
   ONCE after the entire `/ztn:process` flow completes — or just wait
   for the first weekly Monday-UTC tick which fires F.3 automatically.
   First lint promotes/dismisses the {N_princ} bootstrap-origin
   principle candidates and starts populating
   `_system/views/constitution-core.md`.

5. **From here on**: drop new transcripts into `_sources/inbox/` as
   they accrue, run `/ztn:process` (manual or scheduled), invoke
   `/ztn:capture-candidate` in-the-moment when you state a personal
   principle. Weekly `/ztn:lint` keeps hygiene.

**Doctrine transmission — confirmed.** The engine's operating
philosophy is now anchored in three independent paths so it survives
any single point of failure:

- `~/.claude/rules/ztn-engine-doctrine.md` → `_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md`
  (auto-loaded in every Claude Code session in this repo via the
  `install.sh` symlink chain)
- `_system/views/CURRENT_CONTEXT.md` frontmatter `engine_doctrine`,
  `processing_principles`, `constitution_core` keys (any skill
  loading just CURRENT_CONTEXT inherits the pointers)
- Explicit Step 1 / Contracts loads inside `/ztn:process`,
  `/ztn:maintain`, `/ztn:lint`, `/ztn:bootstrap` SKILL.md (the four
  pipeline skills that make the most judgements)

Future processing inherits the frame. If you ever feel a future
`/ztn:process` batch is operating against a different philosophy,
the doctrine likely drifted in one of those three paths — check
them in order.
```

## CLARIFICATIONS examples

Write to `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` under `## bootstrap YYYY-MM-DD` header.

**Mandatory fields (applied к all bootstrap items):**
- `**Type:**` — reason code. Canonical list:
  - `tier-promote-suggested` / `tier-demote-candidate`
  - `thread-closure-suggested`
  - `focus-ambiguous`
  - `people-bare-name`
  - `people-candidate-suggested` (raw scan found unregistered name)
  - `project-candidate-suggested` (raw scan / profile suggested project row)
  - `hub-candidate-suggested` (topic cluster crossed support threshold; no file created)
  - `profile-gap` (profile section still on placeholder default — expected fill)
  - `profile-merge-conflict` (multiple profile files disagree on a section)
  - `process-compatibility` (schema mismatch noticed during raw scan)

> **Note on bare-name items (updated 2026-04-24):** per `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` «People inclusion» rule, routine bare-name mentions encountered during bootstrap should be appended to `_system/state/people-candidates.jsonl` via `python3 _system/scripts/append_person_candidate.py` instead of raising a CLARIFICATION — unless the high-importance escape hatch fires (external/client meeting, full surname present, role+context fully specified). Bootstrap runs once on a fresh base and can produce many bare-name mentions; buffer-routing keeps CLARIFICATIONS queue manageable. `/ztn:lint` Scan C.5 aggregates weekly.
- `**Subject:**` — primary entity id
- `**Source:**` — `bootstrap-{YYYY-MM-DD}` or specific file path
- `**Suggested action:**` — canonical verb from the Resolution-action vocabulary (see `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md`) or descriptive (reminder items)
- `**Confidence tier:**` — surfaced (bootstrap always surfaces — never auto-applies)
- `**Quote:**` — verbatim fragment when source = транскрипт (для person-bare-name items)
- `**Context:**` — 2-4 sentence paragraph (self-contained для LLM review session)
- `**To resolve:**` — imperative unblock instruction

## bootstrap 2026-04-17

### 2026-04-17 — tier-ambiguity: petya-ivanov

**Type:** tier-promote-suggested
**Subject:** petya-ivanov
**Source:** bootstrap-2026-04-17
**Confidence tier:** surfaced
**Suggested action:** promote-tier OR fix-process (dedup rule)

**Context:** Person `petya-ivanov` упомянут 6 раз structurally, но 4 из 6 — в одной 90-минутной встрече. Применён canonical rule 1-per-file (per `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` Data & Processing Rules) → mentions = 3 → Tier 2. Подтверди или переклассифицируй если контекст meeting был существенно фрагментирован.

**To resolve:** Подтверди dedup rule (1-per-file принят в SYSTEM_CONFIG Data & Processing Rules) или измени → обновить PEOPLE.md Mentions для petya-ivanov соответственно.

### 2026-04-17 — thread-closure-suggested: thread-20260310-strategy-proposal

**Type:** thread-closure-suggested
**Subject:** thread-20260310-strategy-proposal
**Source:** bootstrap-2026-04-17
**Confidence tier:** surfaced
**Suggested action:** pursue-or-close

**Context:** Thread «Strategy proposal от Ивана» last signal 2026-03-18 meeting с комментарием «ждём к концу месяца». В April records — 0 mentions этой темы. Либо closed silently (декабрьские events не документировались), либо stalled. Related: [[ivan-petrov]] primary stakeholder.

**To resolve:** Либо закрой с `Resolution-action: close-thread` + resolution_text, либо `keep-thread-open` если реально ждём.

---

### 2026-04-17 — focus-ambiguous: current-focus-split

**Type:** focus-ambiguous
**Subject:** _system/SOUL.md Focus
**Source:** bootstrap-2026-04-17
**Confidence tier:** surfaced
**Suggested action:** review-soul

**Context:** Current Focus split across 4 streams с density: Restructuring (8 records), Agentic Commerce (6), AI Tools (5), DB Reliability (4). Bootstrap применил conservative default (Primary = Restructuring, Secondary = Agentic Commerce, Tertiary = AI Tools). Corresponds к recent carrier pivot signals. DB Reliability — operational, возможно не Focus-level.

**To resolve:** Подтверди или edit SOUL.md Focus section. Если Tertiary должен быть DB Reliability вместо AI Tools — манual edit.

### 2026-04-17 — people-bare-name: Дима в record 20260403

**Type:** people-bare-name
**Subject:** bare-name «Дима»
**Source:** _sources/processed/plaud/2026-04-03T.../transcript.md
**Confidence tier:** surfaced
**Suggested action:** resolve-bare-name

**Quote:** > «Дима сказал, что по его части Kafka migration уложится в Q2, но нужно определиться с SXP форматом.»

**Context:** Bare «Дима» в record `20260403-meeting-*` без people: entry в frontmatter. В PEOPLE.md registry 4 кандидата: dima-stasenko, dima-anosov, dima-belikov, dima-ladonkin. По контексту (Kafka migration, SXP) — leanс dima-stasenko (Head of International, technical depth), но требуется подтверждение.

**To resolve:** Подтверди person-id или edit frontmatter `people:` list в source record.

### 2026-04-17 — tier-demote-candidate: leha-pugin

**Type:** tier-demote-candidate
**Subject:** leha-pugin
**Source:** bootstrap-2026-04-17
**Confidence tier:** surfaced
**Suggested action:** pursue-or-close

**Context:** Person `leha-pugin` — last mention 2025-11, 0 recent activity в records с Dec 2025. Либо архивировать (status: archived), либо реально остаётся активной связью (offline cadence). HARD RULE: bootstrap никогда не downgrade'ит tier автоматически.

**To resolve:** Либо dismiss (keep active), либо `fix-process` manual edit PEOPLE.md status.
```

## What this skill does NOT do

- Не модифицирует существующие knowledge notes (Evidence Trail backfill — ответственность `/ztn:lint`)
- Не создаёт новые knowledge notes (ответственность `/ztn:process`)
- Не создаёт hub-файлы — даже когда raw scan находит сильные кластеры. Hubs требуют ≥ 3
  knowledge notes per `/ztn:process` Step 3.5; bootstrap surfaces только candidates → CLARIFICATIONS
- Не трогает `_records/` (они уже корректны)
- Не создаёт новые профили в `3_resources/people/` (Tier 2→1 auto-generation — ответственность `/ztn:lint`)
- Не запускает `/ztn:process`
- **Не перемещает транскрипты из inbox в processed** — это ответственность `/ztn:process`.
  Raw scan читает транскрипты read-only.
- **Исключение:** консумированный `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/` каталог
  ПЕРЕМЕЩАЕТСЯ в `_sources/processed/crafted/describe-me/` после Step 2 — это reference
  материал, не транскрипт; matches owner's existing layout
- **Не парсит транскрипт на structured records/notes** — bootstrap извлекает signal classes
  (people, projects, hub-candidates, principle-candidates, threads, focus), а не полный content.
  Для onboarding друга: он запускает bootstrap для seed registries → потом `/ztn:process` для
  полной обработки inbox

---

## Idempotency

Повторный запуск:

- **Threads** — match by `thread-id`. Existing Active stay unless closure detected. Resolved never re-open
- **PEOPLE.md** — mentions recomputed from scratch. Tier upgrades only (downgrade требует explicit `/ztn:lint` suggestion через CLARIFICATIONS)
- **CLARIFICATIONS** — previous answers preserved. New questions под новой `## bootstrap YYYY-MM-DD` header; не перезаписывают предыдущие
- **SOUL.md** — если `--skip-soul` или пользователь вручную редактировал → не перезаписывается. Иначе перезапись с сохранением Working Style + Context for Agents секций при наличии текста
- **PROJECTS.md** — candidate rows added by id; existing rows never overwritten. If a candidate id matches an existing row, increment mention count surfaced via CLARIFICATION rather than rewrite the row
- **principle-candidates.jsonl** — append-only buffer. Re-running bootstrap appends new candidates only when their `(situation, observation, hypothesis)` triple is not already present in the buffer (dedup against last 30 days of entries)
- **describe-me/ move** — happens once. On re-run, source is already in `_sources/processed/crafted/describe-me/`; bootstrap re-reads from there with no further move
