  Outside-view observation runner for the ZTN base. Reads
  _system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md, filters lenses that are due per

  _system/agent-lens/{id}/{date}.md and machine index to
  _system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl. Each lens is independent — no

# /ztn:agent-lens — Agent-Lens Observation Runner

Autonomous observer of the ZTN base. Each registered lens is a narrow
intent (stalled threads, stated-vs-lived gap, recurring reaction, etc.)
that runs on its own cadence and produces structured observations the
owner reviews on their own schedule.

**Philosophy:**
- Thinker-free, structurer-strict — primary LLM (Opus or equivalent)
  writes free-form analysis; separate cheap LLM (Haiku/Sonnet) reformats
  to canonical schema. Decoupling so thinking is not biased by
  formatting pressure.
- Hypothesis-grade, not fact — outputs are the agent's hypotheses about
  patterns. Owner judges on review. Skill never auto-promotes a lens
  observation to constitution / knowledge / hub / clarification.
- Per-lens isolation — lenses are independent. No cross-lens synthesis
  at runner level. A meta-lens with `input_type: lens-outputs` may
  produce pointers (counts/dates/ids/short-titles), never content
  citations from other lenses.
- Best-effort over hard-fail — single lens error never aborts the run;
  errors surface to log + CLARIFICATIONS as designed. Run continues
  with remaining lenses.
- Cadence-honest — scheduler fires daily; per-lens cadence is enforced
  inside the skill via `is_due()` filter. Daily tick ≠ daily lens runs.
- Isolation by construction — every Stage 1 / Stage 2 invocation is a
  fresh LLM API call with empty conversation history. No cross-lens
  carry-over, no cross-stage carry-over, no inheritance of skill
  orchestrator system prompt. Direct API calls only — never subagent
  dispatch. See Step 4.5 for the load-bearing contract.
- Surface-everything to CLARIFICATIONS — any unexpected condition
  (registry error, malformed lens, LLM exhaustion after retries,
  IO failure, missing context, unhandled exception) becomes a row
  in `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` plus a log entry. Never silent
  failure, never owner pause, never auto-recovery beyond the explicit
  retry policy in §4.5.5. Doctrine §3.1 — surface, don't decide
  silently.

**Language convention (load-bearing):**

Establish and lock the user-facing language at the very first turn:

- **User-facing output** — exit status messages, CLARIFICATIONS rows,
  summaries surfaced to the owner, error messages — MUST be in the
  owner's language. Detect from: (1) most recent records in
  `_records/` (last 7 days, language of body text), (2) `SOUL.md`
  body text, (3) fall back to English if neither is decisive. The
  detection happens during Step 1 context load.
- **Generated lens content** — observations written by the thinker,
  formatted by the structurer — MUST be in the language the lens
  prompt is written in. Each lens prompt's `## Намерение` /
  `## Intent` line establishes per-lens language; thinker follows.
- **Internal artefacts** — `_system/state/log_agent_lens.md` block
  headers, `_system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl` field values,
  exit-status tokens, error codes, file paths — English only
  (debugging + machine-readability). Never localised.

This mirrors `/ztn:process` convention («язык контента = язык
оригинала») and aligns with `/ztn:agent-lens-add` (which detects from
conversation tone). All ZTN skills follow the same shape: user-facing
in user's language, machine state in English.

**Documentation convention:** при любых edits этого SKILL соблюдай
`_system/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — файл описывает current behavior без
version/phase/rename-history narratives.

**Contracts:**
- `_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` — operating philosophy (load first):
  §3.1 surface-don't-decide, §3.3 idempotency, §3.4 lock matrix,
  §3.5 logs, §3.6 owner-LLM contract (this skill never auto-promotes)
- `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` — log file ownership, cross-skill
  exclusion matrix, CLARIFICATIONS format
- `_system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md` — lens registry schema, cadence
  semantics, lens lifecycle, registry validation rules
- `_system/registries/lenses/_frame.md` — two-stage frame (thinker +
  structurer), validator rules, self-history stances

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` supports:
- `--all-due` (default if no other mode flag) — run every active lens
  whose cadence indicates it is due today. Used by the scheduled tick.
- `--lens <id>` — run a single named lens regardless of due-status.
  Owner-driven testing.
- `--include-draft` — only meaningful with `--lens`; allows running a
  lens with `status: draft`. Without this flag, draft lenses are
  skipped even when explicitly named.
- `--dry-run` — execute the full pipeline including LLM calls, but do
  NOT write outputs to `_system/agent-lens/`, do NOT append to
  runs.jsonl, do NOT modify lens status. Print Stage 2 output to stdout
  for inspection. Used during lens prompt iteration.
- `--force` — bypass the «another agent-lens run completed <30min ago»
  guard. Useful when the owner is iterating manually.
- `--no-sync-check` — skip the data-freshness pre-flight (see below).

Modes are mutually exclusive in spirit: `--lens X` overrides `--all-due`.
The scheduled tick uses `--all-due` only.

---

## Pre-flight: data freshness (non-blocking)

Multi-device safeguard. If `origin` has commits not yet pulled, the
agent-lens may produce observations on a stale view of the records,
duplicating work another device's tick already completed.

Skip with `--no-sync-check` (the scheduled tick passes this implicitly
because Step 1 of the scheduler-prompt runs `/ztn:sync-data` first).

```bash
if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
  branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  remote_ahead=$(git rev-list --count "HEAD..origin/${branch}" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
fi
```

- `origin` not configured, or fetch failed (offline) → silently proceed.
- `remote_ahead == 0` → silently proceed.
- `remote_ahead > 0` → render owner-facing prompt:
  ```
  ⓘ origin/<branch> ahead by <N> commit(s). Lens observations on a
    stale base may duplicate work already done elsewhere.

    [s] run /ztn:sync-data first  (recommended — abort current run)
    [c] continue with current local state
    [d] show pending commits         (then re-prompt)
  ```
  - `s`: print «owner: run `/ztn:sync-data`, then re-run
    `/ztn:agent-lens`», exit 0.
  - `c`: proceed.
  - `d`: `git log HEAD..origin/$branch --oneline`, then re-prompt s/c.

Courtesy nudge, not a gate. `c` is always safe.

---

## Error handling principle (applies to every step)

Single rule: **any unexpected condition → CLARIFICATIONS + log +
proceed-or-exit per severity**. Never silent failure, never owner pause.

Severity → action map:

| Class | Examples | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Catastrophic** (cannot proceed at all) | missing `_frame.md`, missing `AGENT_LENSES.md`, registry table unparseable, lock acquisition failed mid-tick, unhandled exception | Append CLARIFICATION «agent-lens: {cause}» under `## Open Items`, write log entry, release lock (finally), exit with non-success status. **Do NOT** continue to other lenses. |
| **Lens-level** (one lens broken, others fine) | lens folder missing, frontmatter incomplete, `id` collision, `cadence_anchor`/`cadence` mismatch, `self_history` invalid, lens prompt unreadable | Append CLARIFICATION «agent-lens: lens {id} {cause}», log entry, **skip this lens, continue** with remaining due lenses. |
| **Run-level recoverable** (transient) | LLM timeout, rate-limit, 5xx, partial network failure | Retry per §4.5.5 (2 attempts, fresh context). After exhaustion → log `status: error` only (no CLARIFICATION — transient, not actionable by owner). Continue to next lens. |
| **Quality issue** (output produced but invalid) | structurer output fails validator, cited paths don't resolve, schema mismatch | Save raw to `_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/`, log `status: rejected`, continue. CLARIFICATION raised ONLY on auto-pause trigger (3 consecutive rejections per §5.5). |
| **Owner-action-required** (system needs attention) | auto-pause after 3 rejections, registry collision, `cadence_anchor` impossible | Append CLARIFICATION explicitly naming what owner should do, log entry, continue. |

Defaults if condition is novel and not classified above: treat as
**Catastrophic** (CLARIFICATION + exit) — better to surface a stop than
to silently swallow an unknown.

CLARIFICATIONS rows ALWAYS include:
- Timestamp (run_at)
- Lens id (if scoped to one lens)
- Cause (the specific error message / detected condition)
- Where to look (`log_agent_lens.md` block ref, rejected-output path,
  registry row, etc.)
- Suggested owner action (one line)

Never write a CLARIFICATION without all five fields. Doctrine §3.1.

---

## Step 0 — Early Exit Check + Cross-Skill Lock Awareness

**FIRST action.** No context load, no work until passed.

### 0.1 Early exit check

If `--all-due`: load registry briefly (just the table, not lens
prompts). Compute due set via `is_due()` (Step 4). If empty → report
«no lenses due today» and **exit immediately**. No lock, no further
context loading.

If `--lens <id>`: skip this check (owner explicitly named a target).

This saves a full registry parse + lock churn on no-op days (most days,
since most lenses have weekly+ cadence).

### 0.2 Cross-skill lock check (HARD contract — symmetric mutual exclusion)

Read all four lock files in order:
1. `_sources/.processing.lock` — exists → abort с `"/ztn:process running, try again later"`
2. `_sources/.maintain.lock` — exists → abort с `"/ztn:maintain running, try again later"`
3. `_sources/.lint.lock` — exists → abort с `"/ztn:lint running, try again later"`
4. `_sources/.agent-lens.lock` — exists → abort с `"another /ztn:agent-lens run in progress"`

All four skills mutually exclusive (matches doctrine §3.4).

Stale lock (>2h old, parse ISO timestamp from file content) → warn,
report PID if present, **offer manual removal, do NOT auto-delete.**
Auto-clean is the scheduler-prompt's responsibility, not the skill's
— skills are conservative because human may still be inspecting the
crashed-run side effects.

### 0.3 Recent-run check

Read last entry of `_system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl`. If most
recent entry across ALL lenses has `run_at` < 30 minutes ago, report:
```
agent-lens ran {N} minutes ago (last entry: {timestamp}). Pass --force
to proceed anyway.
```
Exit unless `--force`.

Rationale: 30 min is shorter than lint's 6h because agent-lens has no
cumulative LLM-cache state to protect; the guard exists only to prevent
accidental double-runs from the owner re-firing while a tick is queueing.

The scheduled tick passes `--force` implicitly via cron timing alignment
(daily at 07:00 — never <30min from prior tick by construction).

---

## Step 0.5 — Concurrency Lock

Create `_sources/.agent-lens.lock` with content:
```
{ISO UTC timestamp} — agent-lens run, PID {pid}, mode: {all-due|lens X|dry-run}, args: {$ARGUMENTS}
```

**Finally semantics mandatory:** lock release in every exit path
(normal completion, skip, exception, malformed abort). Wrap Steps 1-9
in try/finally; delete lock in finally. If crashed mid-run, next
invocation detects stale lock → warn owner, manual removal recommended.

`--dry-run` still acquires the lock (we're using LLMs, holding the
exclusive resource), and releases it identically.

---

## Step 1 — Context Load

Read in this order:
1. `_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` (operating philosophy + lock matrix)
2. `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` (log ownership, exclusion matrix)
3. `_system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md` (registry table + concept doc)
4. `_system/registries/lenses/_frame.md` (Stage 1/2/3 frame bodies)

If any of these is missing → write CLARIFICATION «agent-lens: required
context file missing: {path}», release lock (finally), exit.

---

## Step 2 — Registry Validation

Parse `AGENT_LENSES.md`. Extract Active and Draft lens tables.

For each lens row in scope (Active for `--all-due`; Active+Draft for
`--lens X --include-draft`; Active for `--lens X` without
`--include-draft`):

1. Resolve folder `_system/registries/lenses/{id}/`. Missing → record
   `registry-error: folder missing for {id}`, append CLARIFICATION,
   skip lens.
2. Resolve `prompt.md` inside that folder. Missing → record
   `registry-error: prompt.md missing for {id}`, skip.
3. Concatenate all `*.md` files in the folder (prompt.md first,
   remainder alphabetically). Parse frontmatter from `prompt.md`.
4. Required fields: `id`, `name`, `type`, `input_type`, `cadence`,
   `cadence_anchor`, `self_history`, `status`. Missing any → skip
   with registry-error. `output_schema` is OPTIONAL and defaults to
   `standard` when absent.
5. Validate field values:
   - `type` ∈ {mechanical, psyche, meta}
   - `input_type` ∈ {records, lens-outputs, multi-source}
   - `output_schema` ∈ {standard, synthesis-custom} (default: standard)
   - `cadence` ∈ {daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly}
   - `cadence_anchor` consistent with `cadence` (weekly/biweekly →
     day-of-week; monthly → day-of-month 1-28; daily → "daily" or
     ignored)
   - `self_history` ∈ {fresh-eyes, longitudinal, lens-decides}
     (no default — missing/invalid value fails validation)
   - `status` ∈ {draft, active, paused}
   - `id` matches folder name
6. Check id uniqueness across all lenses. Collisions → skip both,
   raise CLARIFICATION «agent-lens: id collision {id}».

Lens-level errors → log and skip individual lens, continue. Registry-
level table parse failure (whole `AGENT_LENSES.md` malformed) → write
CLARIFICATION, release lock, exit.

---

## Step 3 — Filter Due Lenses

Apply mode flags:

- `--all-due`: keep lenses where `status == active` AND
  `is_due(lens, today)`.
- `--lens <id>`: keep only the matching lens. Status check:
  - `active` → run
  - `draft` → require `--include-draft`, else abort with message
  - `paused` → abort with message «lens {id} is paused; un-pause in
    registry to run»

`is_due(lens, today)` semantics + catch-up policy: canonical in
`AGENT_LENSES.md` Cadence semantics section.

Runner specifics: `last_run` is the most recent entry for this `lens_id`
in `_system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl` with `status` ∈ {ok, empty}.
Rejected/error runs do NOT count as last_run, so a run that produced
nothing valid will be retried on next due-day.

---

## Step 4 — Order Lenses

Sort the due list:
1. `input_type == records` first (in registry order)
2. `input_type == lens-outputs` middle (in registry order)
3. `input_type == multi-source` last (in registry order)

Rationale: meta-lenses (`lens-outputs`) read other lenses' outputs
from the current run, so non-meta must complete first within the
same tick. Synthesis lenses (`multi-source`) read both primary
data AND lens outputs (including meta-lens outputs like
global-navigator), so they run last.

---

## Step 4.5 — Isolation contract (load-bearing)

Every lens executes in full isolation. The runner enforces this at
four levels. Violating any one breaks the design — observations from
one lens MUST NOT influence another, and orchestration noise MUST NOT
reach the thinker.

### 4.5.1 Per-lens isolation

Lens N's Stage 1 invocation has zero visibility into Lens N-1's input,
output, intermediate state, or the orchestrator's loop variables. The
ONLY shared structure across lenses is the orchestrator's per-tick
loop, and the orchestrator is plain code (Python / runtime), not an
LLM that could leak state into prompts.

Concretely:
- The orchestrator does NOT keep a persistent LLM conversation
  spanning lenses.
- The orchestrator does NOT pass «what previous lenses found» as
  context to the next lens.
- Each lens gets its own pair of API calls (Stage 1 + Stage 2),
  fully decoupled from the rest of the tick.

### 4.5.2 Per-stage isolation

Stage 2 (structurer) is a SEPARATE API call from Stage 1 (thinker).
The thinker output is passed to the structurer as user-message text
input — NOT as a conversation continuation.

Structurer has zero LLM-level awareness that Stage 1 ever happened.
From its perspective, it received a string of free-form analysis and
must reformat it. This is critical because:
- Structurer in conversation mode would treat the thinker as an
  «interlocutor» and could feel licensed to argue, expand, or push
  back. We don't want that — we want strict reformatting.
- Cross-stage caching of context can leak Stage 1 system prompt into
  Stage 2 reasoning.

### 4.5.3 No subagent dispatch

Stage 1 and Stage 2 calls MUST be direct LLM API invocations. The
following are forbidden:
- Claude Code Task tool / Agent tool dispatch
- «general-purpose agent» wrappers
- Any pattern that injects its own system prompt around the frame

Two reasons:

(a) Subagents carry a foreign system prompt («You are a general-
    purpose agent...») that biases the thinker — overriding or
    diluting the frame's instructions. The whole point of the frame
    is that thinker sees ONLY the frame, nothing else.

(b) The scheduler tick contract (`agent-lens-scheduled.md`) bans
    sub-agent spawn for lock-deadlock reasons: the parent holds
    `_sources/.agent-lens.lock`, the child polls for it, deadlock.

### 4.5.4 Fresh context per call

Each LLM invocation, both Stage 1 and Stage 2, MUST have:

- **System prompt** = exactly the frame body for that stage (from
  `_frame.md`). NOTHING prepended or appended. No «you are running
  inside /ztn:agent-lens» framing. No skill-description preamble.
  No CLAUDE.md content, no auto-loaded rules, no environment block.
  If the runtime auto-injects context, the runner MUST suppress it
  for these calls.

- **User message** = exactly the assembled lens prompt (Stage 1) or
  the thinker output + lens metadata (Stage 2). No additional
  instructions.

- **Conversation history** = empty. New session every call.

- **Prompt cache** = the frame body MAY be cached across lenses
  (it is byte-identical). Lens-specific content (lens prompt body,
  thinker output) MUST NOT be cached across lenses or stages.

### 4.5.5 Retry behaviour

On transient error (timeout, rate-limit, 5xx), retry is ALSO a fresh
context — same isolation contract applies. The runner does NOT pass
the failed attempt as «previous attempt» context. It makes a clean
new call with the original assembled prompt.

Retry budget: 2 attempts max per stage per lens. After 2 failures →
log `status: error`, `rejection_reason: stage{N}-{cause}-retries-
exhausted`, continue to next lens.

### 4.5.6 Parallelism (optional, owner-driven)

Lenses MAY run in parallel API calls — there is no shared context to
corrupt by construction. Tradeoffs:

- ✅ Faster total tick time (N lenses sequentially ≈ N × 30-60s; parallel
  ≈ max single lens ≈ 30-60s regardless of N)
- ❌ Bursty rate-limit usage; risk of provider throttling
- ❌ Meta-lenses (`input_type: lens-outputs`) MUST still wait for all
  non-meta lenses to complete (otherwise they read partial state)
- ❌ Synthesis lenses (`input_type: multi-source`) MUST wait for both
  non-meta and meta lenses to complete — they read both primary data
  and other lenses' outputs (including meta-lens outputs from this
  same tick)

Default: **sequential, in registry order respecting Step 4 ordering
(records → lens-outputs → multi-source)**. Parallelism is opt-in via
a future runner flag (not implemented today). Spec it here so the
isolation contract is unambiguous when the flag lands: parallel
batching applies only within each `input_type` cohort, never crosses
the cohort barrier (records cohort completes → lens-outputs cohort
completes → multi-source cohort completes), and each call still
satisfies §§4.5.1-4.5.5.

---

## Step 5 — Per-Lens Execution

For each ordered due lens, execute Steps 5.1-5.5 sequentially. Errors
in one lens do NOT abort the loop.

### 5.1 Assemble Stage 1 prompt

Concatenate, in order:
1. Stage 1 frame body for `input_type` (extracted from `_frame.md`):
   - `records` → base-input variant (lens prompt scopes which layer is primary)
   - `lens-outputs` → lens-outputs-input variant
   - `multi-source` → multi-source-input variant (synthesis lenses; lens
     prompt carries its own output schema, written directly without
     Stage 2 reformat)
2. Lens folder content (prompt.md first, other `*.md` alphabetically)
3. Self-history hint (depends on `self_history` value):
   - `fresh-eyes` → frame mentions: «do not read your own past outputs»
   - `longitudinal` → frame mentions:
     «past outputs available at `_system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/`; use
     as context, not as evidence — see lens prompt for guidance.
     Skip outputs that are superseded by a later run on the same
     date — `runs.jsonl` entries with a `supersedes` field point to
     the prior `run_at` they replace; the per-day file on disk
     reflects the latest run only»
   - `lens-decides` → frame mentions same path; lens prompt itself
     decides whether to read

**Supersedes filter (longitudinal lookup).** When the runner reads
`agent-lens-runs.jsonl` for past `last_run` of this lens, exclude any
entry whose `run_at` is referenced by a later entry's `supersedes`
field. Same-day re-runs (e.g. owner iterating during prompt
calibration) leave a chain in `runs.jsonl` but only the last file on
disk; the longitudinal view should mirror what is actually persisted.
The thinker is told the same in the self-history hint above so it
does not double-count an iteration as two independent past surfaces.

### 5.2 Stage 1 — Thinker call

**Isolation contract: see Step 4.5.** Direct API call, fresh context,
no subagent.

Invoke primary LLM (Opus or equivalent) with:
- **System prompt** = `_frame.md` Stage 1 body for the lens's
  `input_type` — base-input variant for `records`, lens-outputs
  variant for `lens-outputs`, multi-source-input variant for
  `multi-source`. Exact text, nothing prepended/appended.
- **User message** = assembled lens prompt from Step 5.1 (lens folder
  content + self-history hint).
- **Tool access** = read-only filesystem tools across the ZTN base.
  Thinker decides what to read.
- **Conversation history** = empty.

Output: free-form text. Capture verbatim. Do NOT trim, summarise, or
rewrite before passing to Stage 2.

LLM error (timeout, API failure, refusal):
- Up to 2 retry attempts (each a fresh-context call per §4.5.5).
- After exhaustion: log entry to `agent-lens-runs.jsonl` with
  `status: error`, `rejection_reason: stage1-{cause}-retries-
  exhausted`. Append entry to `log_agent_lens.md`. Continue to
  next lens.

### 5.3 Stage 2 — Structurer call

**Branch on `output_schema`:**

- `output_schema: standard` (default; existing lenses) — execute
  Stage 2 structurer call as below.
- `output_schema: synthesis-custom` — **SKIP this step entirely.**
  Thinker output from Step 5.2 is the final artefact; it is treated
  as if it had passed through structurer unchanged. Proceed directly
  to Step 5.4 with the thinker output as the structured artefact.
  Rationale: synthesis lenses carry their own output schema in the
  lens prompt and the thinker writes directly to it — running a
  structurer pass would either duplicate work or risk reformatting
  away analytical structure the thinker chose deliberately.

For `output_schema: standard`:

**Isolation contract: see Step 4.5.** Separate API call from Stage 1,
NOT a continuation. Thinker output is INPUT TEXT, not conversation.

Invoke cheaper LLM (Haiku or Sonnet) with:
- **System prompt** = `_frame.md` Stage 2 body. Exact text.
- **User message** = thinker output (verbatim) + lens metadata
  (`lens_id`, `run_at` captured at start of 5.2).
- **Tool access** = none required (pure formatting task).
- **Conversation history** = empty.

Output: structured markdown per canonical schema in `_frame.md`.

LLM error:
- Up to 2 retry attempts (fresh-context per §4.5.5).
- After exhaustion: log `status: error`, `rejection_reason:
  stage2-{cause}-retries-exhausted`, append run record, continue.

### 5.4 Validator (structural, deterministic)

Validator rules canonical in `_frame.md` Stage 3. Apply the branch
matching the lens's `output_schema`:

- `output_schema: standard` → full canonical-schema validation
  (frontmatter privacy trio, `## Observation N` structure with
  Pattern / Evidence / Alternative reading / Confidence, cited path
  resolution).
- `output_schema: synthesis-custom` → relaxed validation (frontmatter
  privacy trio + `lens_id` + `run_at`, non-empty body, cited ZTN
  paths resolve to existing files). The lens prompt owns its internal
  section structure; runner does not enforce it.

**Pass:**
- Write output to `_system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.
  If file already exists for today (re-run scenario), overwrite.
- Append to `agent-lens-runs.jsonl` with `status: ok` (hits>0) or
  `status: empty` (hits==0).

**Fail:**
- Save Stage 2 raw output to
  `_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/{lens-id}/{run_at-iso}.md`.
- Append run record with `status: rejected`,
  `rejection_reason: {validator-failure-summary}`.
- Do NOT write to `_system/agent-lens/`.

### 5.5 Consecutive-rejection auto-pause

After updating runs.jsonl, look at the last 3 entries for this
`lens_id`. If all 3 have `status: rejected`:
- Update lens frontmatter `status: paused` in
  `_system/registries/lenses/{lens-id}/prompt.md`
- **Move** the row in `AGENT_LENSES.md` from `## Active Lenses` to
  `## Paused/Archived Lenses` (split-table per Archive Contract Form B
  in `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md`), populating the row with:
  - `Status: paused`
  - `Paused: {today}`
  - `Reason: "auto-pause: 3 consecutive validator rejections"`
  Atomic write — never leave the row in Active with `Status: paused`.
- Append CLARIFICATION «agent-lens: {id} auto-paused after 3
  consecutive validator rejections — see
  `_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/{id}/` for raw outputs»

---

## Step 5.9 — Privacy trio + concept fields on lens-observation entities

Lens outputs are written as markdown observation files; per
ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.8 they are Tier 2 entities and **must carry
the privacy trio** (`origin`, `audience_tags`, `is_sensitive`) on
every emission. Apply these defaults at write time:

- `origin: personal` — lens observations are owner-internal
  hypothesis-grade analysis; never `work` (would leak to work-team
  in a future sync) or `external` (lens is internal).
- `audience_tags: []` — lens output is owner-only by construction.
  Never widened automatically; owner curates if they want to share
  a specific lens result.
- `is_sensitive: false` by default; `true` if the lens prompt
  explicitly asks the model to surface sensitive patterns
  (e.g. relationship/conflict observations) — consult the lens's
  `output_sensitivity` registry field if present, default `false`
  otherwise.

If a lens output references concepts by name, every concept-name
string MUST be normalised through
`_system/scripts/_common.py::normalize_concept_name()` at write
time (same autonomous-resolution contract as `/ztn:process`
Q15) — drop unnormalisables, never transliterate, never raise
CLARIFICATION. Lens outputs that wind up in the manifest pipeline
inherit conformance via this gate, so downstream Minder consumers
see the same clean concept/audience surface as for records and
notes.

## Step 5.95 — Emit batch manifest (universal contract)

Per ENGINE_DOCTRINE §3.8 and ARCHITECTURE.md §8.11.1, every ZTN engine
skill that produces persistent state changes emits a JSON manifest at
`_system/state/batches/{batch_id}-{skill}.json`. The
`agent-lens-runs.jsonl` log stays as audit trail, but downstream
consumers receive lens-observation upserts via the same universal
manifest path as the other three skills — uniform parsing, uniform
idempotency.

**When to emit:** at the END of the tick (after Step 5 across all due
lenses, before Step 6 Log Summary). One manifest per tick — covers
ALL lenses run in this tick, not one per lens. This matches the
"batch" semantic of the contract (a lens-tick is a batch of lens
observations).

**When to SKIP emission:** dry-run mode, or zero lenses with
`status: ok` in the tick (every lens was empty / rejected /
auto-paused). The manifest is opt-in evidence of state change; an
empty tick has nothing to write.

**Where to emit:**
- `batch_id` = UTC timestamp `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` of tick start (the
  same `run_at` used for the runs.jsonl entries).
- File path: `_system/state/batches/{batch_id}-agent-lens.json`.

**Schema:** `manifest-schema/v2.json`. Required top-level keys:
`batch_id`, `timestamp`, `format_version: "2.0"`,
`processor: "ztn:agent-lens"`, `stats`. Substantive payload lives in
`tier2_objects.lens_observation.upserts[]` — one entry per lens that
emitted an observation this tick (status `ok`, including hits>0; skip
`empty` and `rejected`).

**Per-observation entry:**

```json
{
  "id": "lens-obs-{lens-id}-{YYYYMMDD}",
  "lens_name": "{lens-id}",
  "observed_on": "{YYYY-MM-DD}",
  "observation_period": "{free-form: e.g. 'last 4 weeks'}",
  "body_markdown": "{full content of {date}.md, minus frontmatter}",
  "is_hypothesis": true,
  "generated_by_lens_run": "{runs.jsonl entry id or run_at iso}",
  "related_concepts": ["{snake_case names referenced in observation}"],
  "related_entity_refs": {"decisions_referenced": [...], "threads_referenced": [...]},
  "prompt_version": "{lens-id}@{version from registry frontmatter, default 'unversioned'}",
  "path": "_system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/{date}.md",
  "checksum_sha256": "{sha256 of the .md file bytes}",
  "origin": "personal",
  "audience_tags": [],
  "is_sensitive": "{from Step 5.9: false default; true if lens registry output_sensitivity=true}"
}
```

**`stats` shape:**

```json
{
  "lenses_considered": N,
  "lenses_run": N,
  "lenses_skipped_not_due": N,
  "lenses_skipped_registry_error": N,
  "lenses_failed": N,
  "observations_emitted": N,
  "candidates_appended": N,
  "clarifications_raised": N,
  "duration_seconds": N
}
```

**Emission via the helper:**

```bash
python3 _system/scripts/emit_batch_manifest.py \
    --input <path-to-temp-json> \
    --output _system/state/batches/{batch_id}-agent-lens.json
```

The helper applies the same producer-side normalisations as for
`/ztn:process`: concept-name conformance, audience-tag whitelist
filtering, privacy-trio coercion, empty-section shape coercion. Exit
codes per `emit_batch_manifest.py` docstring; treat exit 3 the same
way `/ztn:process` does — surface as a `process-compatibility`
CLARIFICATION ONLY if root cause cannot be auto-corrected in the
accumulator assembly.

**Failure semantics:** if the JSON write fails, KEEP the
`agent-lens-runs.jsonl` entries already written and the
`_system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/{date}.md` files already on disk
(observation files ARE the authoritative artefact; the manifest is
downstream-routing). Surface as «agent-lens manifest write failed —
{cause}» CLARIFICATION; the next tick will re-attempt. Do not add a
BATCH_LOG.md row (`/ztn:agent-lens` does not write to BATCH_LOG —
that index is `/ztn:process` only).

---

## Step 6 — Log Summary

Append to `_system/state/log_agent_lens.md` a single block:

```
## {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ} — agent-lens run

Mode: --all-due | --lens X | --dry-run
Lenses considered: {count}
Lenses run: {count}
  - {lens-id}: {status} ({hits} hits, {duration_seconds}s)
  - ...
Lenses skipped (registry errors): {count}
Lenses skipped (not due): {count}
Lenses auto-paused this run: {list or "none"}
Total duration: {seconds}
```

`--dry-run` adds `[dry-run]` prefix in title and includes a note
«files NOT written» at end.

---

## Step 7 — Cleanup

- Delete `_sources/.agent-lens.lock` (in finally — guaranteed).
- Exit with single-line status:
  - `success` — all due lenses completed pipeline cleanly (some may
    be empty / rejected — those count as completed runs from the
    pipeline's POV)
  - `partial` — at least one lens errored at LLM/IO level (NOT
    validator rejection — those count as completed)
  - `lens-locked` — aborted at Step 0.2, lock active
  - `registry-error` — aborted at Step 2, registry malformed beyond
    individual-lens skip
  - `dry-run-complete` — `--dry-run` mode finished
  - `recent-run-blocked` — Step 0.3 blocked, no `--force`

---

## Skill-level invariants (doctrine §3.6)

- Never auto-promote a lens observation to constitution, knowledge,
  hub, or any owner-curated artefact. Outputs stay in
  `_system/agent-lens/{id}/` until owner manually promotes.
- Never overwrite owner edits to a lens prompt. If owner has modified
  `prompt.md` for a paused lens, do not silently un-pause.
- Never delete from `_sources/`. (This skill does not touch
  `_sources/` content — only writes its own `.lock` file there.)
- Never modify `0_constitution/`, `5_meta/mocs/`, `_system/SOUL.md`,
  `_system/registries/PEOPLE.md`, `_system/registries/PROJECTS.md`,
  `_system/state/OPEN_THREADS.md`. The lens **reads** these (via the
  thinker); the runner never writes to them.
- Never include lens outputs (`_system/agent-lens/`) or rejected
  outputs (`_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/`) in default search
  scope. Other skills that perform full-base search MUST exclude
  these paths (until QMD-isolation phase lands).

## Files written by this skill

Full descriptions in `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` Files Reference.
Per-run write surface:

- `_system/agent-lens/{lens-id}/{date}.md` — overwrite if same date
- `_system/state/batches/{batch_id}-agent-lens.json` — once per tick (Step 5.95), only when ≥1 lens emitted with `status: ok`
- `_system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl` — append-only
- `_system/state/log_agent_lens.md` — append-only
- `_system/state/agent-lens-rejected/{lens-id}/{run_at}.md` — append
- `_sources/.agent-lens.lock` — create + delete (concurrency lock)
- `_system/registries/lenses/{lens-id}/prompt.md` — frontmatter `status`
  only, only on auto-pause
- `_system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md` — status column only, only on
  auto-pause
- `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` — append on registry errors / lock
  contention / auto-pause / missing context

## Files read by this skill

The thinker (Stage 1) has full read access to the ZTN base. The runner
itself reads:
- `_system/registries/AGENT_LENSES.md`, `lenses/**`
- `_system/agent-lens/**` (only when lens is `longitudinal` /
  `lens-decides`, or for meta-lenses)
- `_system/state/agent-lens-runs.jsonl` (last_run + recent-run check)
- `_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md`, `SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` (context load)

---

## Boundary cases

Behaviour following directly from Steps 0-7 (lock contention, registry
errors, validator rejection, --lens on paused, etc.) is described
in-place. Listed here are non-obvious cases that don't follow trivially
from the step text:

| Case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Thinker output but no specific paths | Structurer emits observations with `(no specific paths cited)` evidence; validator passes — diffuse patterns are valid signal, not a bug |
| First-ever run of a lens (no prior `last_run`) | Treat as due if today's date matches `cadence_anchor` |
| Tick spans midnight | `run_at` captured at Step 5.2 start; ALL cadence checks for the run use `today = run_at.date()` (consistency across lenses within one tick) |
| Owner edits a lens prompt mid-tick | Lens already loaded into memory at Step 2; mid-tick edits not picked up. Next tick sees them |
| Two lenses with same id | Both skipped (not first-wins); raises CLARIFICATION «id collision»; remaining lenses run normally |
| `--dry-run` on Active lens | Allowed — useful when iterating prompt of an already-deployed lens |
| `--dry-run` on draft lens | Requires `--lens` + `--include-draft` (testing intent); abort otherwise |

## Coordination with other skills

- `/ztn:lint` — lint may surface stale agent-lens artefacts (orphan
  output dirs for deleted lenses, runs.jsonl entries for removed lens
  ids). This skill does NOT clean those; lint is the cleaner. Adding
  this scan-class to lint is owner-driven future work.
- `/ztn:process` — exclusive via lock matrix. No data overlap on
  output paths (`_records/`, `1_projects/`, `5_meta/` vs
  `_system/agent-lens/`).
- `/ztn:capture-candidate` — independent. Lens observations are NOT
  principle candidates. Owner may, on review, manually create a
  principle candidate inspired by a lens observation; skill does not
  auto-link.
- `/ztn:check-decision` — independent. Owner may, on review, run
  check-decision on a lens observation that touches values. Skill-
  to-skill linkage is owner-mediated, not automated.
- `/ztn:bootstrap` — exclusive. Bootstrap reseeds system state and
  may rewrite registries.
- `/ztn:save` — sequential. Save runs after agent-lens completes;
  not concurrent.

---

## What good looks like (output contract)

A successful tick produces:
- 0 to N output files in `_system/agent-lens/{id}/{date}.md` (one per
  due lens, including empty-result files)
- Exactly N+M+R lines appended to `agent-lens-runs.jsonl` (N=ok,
  M=empty, R=rejected, all due lenses accounted for)
- One block in `log_agent_lens.md`
- 0 or more CLARIFICATIONS (only on registry errors / auto-pause /
  context-file missing)
- Lock file removed
- Exit status 0 with single-line status

The skill is intentionally narrow. Cross-cutting concerns (cleanup
of orphan files, schema migrations of runs.jsonl, archival of old
outputs) are NOT this skill's responsibility — those belong to lint
or owner.
