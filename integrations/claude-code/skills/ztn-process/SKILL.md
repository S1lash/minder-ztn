# /ztn:process — Transcript Processing Pipeline

Process new source files from `_sources/inbox/` into the ZTN three-layer architecture:
- **Records** (`_records/{meetings,observations}/`) — lightweight transcript-grounded logs (meetings = multi-speaker; observations = solo voice / journal / reflection)
- **Knowledge** (PARA: `1_projects/` through `4_archive/`) — atomic insights
- **Hubs** (`5_meta/mocs/`) — synthesis and evolution tracking

**Philosophy:** Inclusion-biased. Better to over-capture than to miss a fact.
Per-batch full-pipeline subagent (Step 3) + producer self-review (Step 3.7) guarantee trustworthiness.

**Documentation convention:** при любых edits этого SKILL соблюдай `_system/docs/CONVENTIONS.md` — файл описывает current behavior без version/phase/rename-history narratives.

> **Schema expectations.** Skill polagaется на наличие системных файлов: `SOUL.md`,
> `OPEN_THREADS.md`, `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`, `log_maintenance.md`, `log_process.md`,
> `log_lint.md`, `BATCH_LOG.md`, `batches/`, `batch-format.md`, `registries/SOURCES.md`;
> расширенная схема PEOPLE.md с колонками Tier/Mentions/Last; `## Evidence Trail` секция
> в knowledge notes. Если во время flow обнаруживается несостыковка (missing file,
> unexpected schema, inconsistent references между registries) — **не останавливаться
> и не гадать**: зафиксировать вопрос в `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` под `## Open Items`
> с type `process-compatibility`, применить conservative default, продолжить обработку.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` supports:
- `--dry-run` — list new files without processing
- `--file <path>` — process a single specific file (skip PROCESSED.md comparison)
- `--reprocess` — re-process files already in PROCESSED.md
- `--no-sync-check` — skip the data-freshness pre-flight (see below)

---

## Pre-flight: data freshness (non-blocking)

Before any heavy work, check if the owner's `origin` has commits not
yet pulled into this clone. Multi-device setups (phone records into
inbox/ on laptop A, this laptop B is a passive consumer) mean local
inbox/ may be stale.

Skip entirely if `--no-sync-check` is passed.

```bash
if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
  branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  remote_ahead=$(git rev-list --count "HEAD..origin/${branch}" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
fi
```

Cases:
- `origin` not configured, or fetch failed (offline) → silently proceed.
- `remote_ahead == 0` → silently proceed.
- `remote_ahead > 0` → render owner-facing prompt:
  ```
  ⓘ origin/<branch> ahead by <N> commit(s). New transcripts may be
    waiting in inbox/ from another device.

    [s] run /ztn:sync-data first  (recommended — abort current /ztn:process)
    [c] continue with current local state  (safe — won't lose anything)
    [d] show pending commits         (then re-prompt)
  ```
  - `s`: print «owner: run `/ztn:sync-data`, then re-run `/ztn:process`», exit 0.
  - `c`: proceed (`remote_ahead` snapshot logged in batch report for traceability).
  - `d`: `git log HEAD..origin/$branch --oneline`, then re-prompt s/c.

The check is a courtesy nudge, not a gate — `c` is always safe (process
operates on local working-tree only; pulled commits won't be lost).

---

## Early Exit Check

**FIRST action — before lock, context, or pre-scan.**

Quick-scan `_sources/inbox/` subdirectories for any transcript files
(`transcript*.md` or `.md` in `crafted/`). Use Glob, not full reads.

- If `--file` or `--reprocess` flag: skip this check (files come from elsewhere).
- If 0 candidate files found: report `"No new transcripts in inbox — nothing to process."` and **exit immediately**. No lock, no context loading, no system file reads.
- If `--dry-run` with 0 files: same — report empty and exit.

This saves ~10 file reads and all pre-scan work on empty runs.

---

## Concurrency Lock

Runs only when Early Exit Check found files to process.

**Cross-skill lock check — read all three lock files first:**
- `_sources/.maintain.lock` — exists → abort «`/ztn:maintain` running, try again later»
- `_sources/.lint.lock` — exists → abort «`/ztn:lint` running, try again later»
- `_sources/.processing.lock` — exists → abort «another `/ztn:process` run in progress»

All three skills mutually exclusive.

1. After cross-skill checks pass, create `_sources/.processing.lock` with content: `{ISO timestamp} — {session info}`
2. On completion (success or failure): **DELETE** `_sources/.processing.lock`

The lock file MUST be deleted in all exit paths — normal completion, errors, and early abort.
If you find a stale lock (>2 hours old), warn the user and offer to delete it.

---

## Step 0.0: Regenerate Constitution Derived Views

Invoke `/ztn:regen-constitution` (or run `python3 _system/scripts/regen_all.py`)
as the very first action. This ensures SOUL.md Values zone,
`_system/views/constitution-core.md`, and `_system/views/CONSTITUTION_INDEX.md`
reflect the current state of `0_constitution/` before any context load.

Consistency rule for the whole platform: every pipeline that reads a derived
view regenerates first. Cost is ~100 ms; the guarantee is that nothing in
Step 1 Context Load is stale relative to source.

Failure of this step is fatal — report the underlying script error and stop.
Partial derived views would poison downstream reasoning.

---

## Step 0: Pre-Scan

Before any processing begins, scan ALL new transcripts to build shared context.

### 0.1 Quick Read

For each new file selected by §2.1 (layout-aware), read a cheap preview:
- If the filename is `transcript_with_summary.md`: read only the summary section (the part AFTER `<transcript_to_summary_delimiter>`). The summary is short — full read is acceptable.
- If the filename is `transcript.md`: read first 50 lines.
- For `flat-md` files (any other filename — sources like `notes`, `crafted`): read first 50 lines.

Extract (quick, no deep analysis):
- Date/timestamp from folder name (`dir-per-item` / `dir-with-summary`) or from filename / mtime (`flat-md`). Folder-name forms accepted are listed in §2.3.
- Names of people mentioned
- Main topics / keywords
- Source type — derived from the parent folder under `_sources/inbox/{source-id}/...`; the canonical whitelist is `_system/registries/SOURCES.md`.

### 0.2 Build People Resolution Map

Collect ALL person names/diminutives across ALL new transcripts.
Load `3_resources/people/PEOPLE.md`.
Resolve each name against the registry.

Three tiers:

| Tier | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| RESOLVED | Unambiguous match to existing person in PEOPLE.md (exact name or alias) | Use existing ID. BINDING — all files must use this ID |
| NEW | No match in PEOPLE.md, enough context to create profile | Assign canonical ID in `firstname-lastname` format NOW. If last name unknown — AMBIGUOUS instead. BINDING — all files must use this ID |
| AMBIGUOUS | Could match multiple people, or unclear identity | Note the ambiguity. Defer to full-context resolution in Step 3.3. Recommendation only |

Fuzzy matching rules:
- Russian diminutives: Серёга→sergey-matveev, Ром/Рома→roman-raspadnyuk, Женя→zhenya-tochilkin, etc.
  Always resolve to the FULL ID (firstname-lastname), never to a bare first name.
- Check `aliases` field in PEOPLE.md
- **Check CLARIFICATIONS.md Resolved Archive** for known transcription artifacts
  (e.g., «Нуара»→lara-neprokina, «Трафт»→vanya-kravets, «Сотки»→maxim-andreev).
  These are RESOLVED tier — use the mapped ID directly.
- First-name-only: if only one person with that name exists → RESOLVED;
  if multiple → AMBIGUOUS

**ID format (MANDATORY):** `firstname-lastname` in transliterated lowercase.
Use the name the author uses in conversation (Дима, not Дмитрий; Леха, not Алексей).
NEVER create IDs without a last name (e.g., `vasily`, `dima`, `misha`).
If the last name is unknown from the transcript — mark as AMBIGUOUS and log to CLARIFICATIONS.md.
Exception: people known only by one name (e.g., psychologist "Татьяна") — must be explicitly justified.

The People Resolution Map is LIVE and MUTABLE. New people discovered during
processing (e.g., surfaced by §3.7 self-review or in subagent's classification
pass) are aggregated post-batch by orchestrator at Step 3.8, ensuring subsequent
runs use consistent IDs.

### 0.3 Hub Signal Matching

Load `_system/views/HUB_INDEX.md`.
Match pre-scan topics/people against the hub index.
For each file, note which hubs it likely touches.
This guides context loading in Step 3.3 — load only relevant hubs, not all of them.

---

## Step 1: Load Context

Read these system files (in parallel where possible):

0. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/docs/ENGINE_DOCTRINE.md` — operating philosophy (load FIRST; binding frame for every step). Cross-skill rules from §3 govern: surface-don't-decide, inclusion-bias-on-capture / curation-on-promotion, idempotency, the owner-LLM contract.
1. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` — note formats, routing rules, naming
2. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/PROCESSING_PRINCIPLES.md` — 8 principles + values profile
3. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/SOUL.md` — identity + current focus + working style (context only)
4. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/views/CURRENT_CONTEXT.md` — live state snapshot (context only)
5. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/state/OPEN_THREADS.md` — open strategic threads (context only)
6. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/3_resources/people/PEOPLE.md` — people registry. Schema: `ID | Name | Role | Org | Profile | Tier | Mentions | Last`. Preserve all columns when writing
7. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/1_projects/PROJECTS.md` — project registry
8. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/registries/TAGS.md` — tag registry (`tags:` namespace labels)
9. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/registries/CONCEPT_NAMING.md` — canonical concept-name format. **Autonomous-pipeline policy:** the engine resolves all concept-name format issues with deterministic heuristics — never raises CLARIFICATIONs, never blocks owner. `_system/scripts/_common.py::normalize_concept_name()` is the single source of truth: normalisation algorithm + drop-on-impossibility (returns `None` to signal skip when non-ASCII residue or empty-after-strip). For non-English source terms, translate semantically to English; if genuinely untranslatable, drop the entry rather than transliterate (transliteration splits graph identity).
10. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/registries/AUDIENCES.md` — `audience_tags` whitelist (canonical five + tenant Extensions). **Autonomous-pipeline policy:** unknown / non-canonical / non-whitelisted tags are silently dropped (entity stays `[]`, owner-only). Helper: `_system/scripts/_common.py::normalize_audience_tag()`. The fail-closed default (`[]`) is the right outcome on any uncertainty — false-positive sharing leaks; false-negative just keeps content owner-only.
11. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/registries/SOURCES.md` — inbox source whitelist (consumed by Step 2.1)
12. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/views/HUB_INDEX.md` — hub index (if not loaded in Step 0)
13. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/state/PROCESSED.md` — already processed files
14. `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` — pending clarifications.
    Also scan **Resolved Archive** table: previously resolved name variants (e.g.,
    «Нуара» = Лара Непрокина, «Трафт» = Кравец). Use these to auto-resolve
    transcription artifacts in new transcripts without re-creating ambiguities.

**CLARIFICATIONS HARD RULE.** При `confidence < threshold` — не принимать решение
молча. Записать вопрос в `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` под `## Open Items`, использовать
conservative default, продолжить работу. Применяется на всех шагах skill.

**SOUL / CURRENT_CONTEXT / OPEN_THREADS — контекст-only.** Не модифицируются этим
skill. Используются для лучшего понимания priority/focus при классификации нот
и адверсариал-аудите. Их incremental обновление — ответственность `/ztn:maintain`.

---

## Step 2: Find New Files

### 2.1 Scan Directories

Load `_system/registries/SOURCES.md` — the whitelist of inbox source types.
SOURCES.md is the **only** place where source-specific behaviour lives; this
SKILL never names individual source IDs.

Iterate over rows in `## Active Sources` and `## Reserved Sources` (skip
`## Deprecated Sources` rows entirely). For each row, scan `Inbox Path`
according to the row's `Layout` column:

| Layout | Scan rule |
|---|---|
| `flat-md` | Glob `{Inbox Path}/*.md` (top-level only — never recurse). |
| `dir-per-item` | For every immediate subfolder of `Inbox Path`, take `transcript.md` if present. |
| `dir-with-summary` | For every immediate subfolder of `Inbox Path`, pick exactly one file with this priority: (1) `transcript_with_summary.md` if present (combined raw+summary, see §3.1 delimiter contract), (2) `transcript.md` otherwise. A folder with NEITHER file is skipped silently (empty / partial export). A folder that has BOTH never reads `transcript.md` — the combined file is canonical. |

For every layout, honour the row's `Skip Subdirs` column — any subdirectory
whose name matches an entry in that comma-separated list is skipped without
warning. Reserved sources may have empty inbox folders; that is expected and
NEVER an error.

Adding a new source is declarative: invoke `/ztn:source-add` (or append a
row to SOURCES.md + create `_sources/inbox/{id}/.gitkeep` and
`_sources/processed/{id}/.gitkeep` manually). No edits to this SKILL.

Everything in `_sources/inbox/` not skipped above is unprocessed — the
filesystem IS the primary filter. PROCESSED.md serves three roles:
1. **Crash recovery** — files are moved to `processed/` BEFORE processing (Step 2.4).
   If a file is in `processed/` but NOT in PROCESSED.md, it was moved but processing
   failed — needs retry.
2. **`--reprocess` support** — identifies which files to re-process from `processed/`.
3. **Audit log** — historical record of all processing operations.

> **Reference material under sources.** Some sources expose reference content
> (identity drafts, policies, AI-generated profiles) inside a subfolder that
> must NEVER reach the processing queue. The mechanism is the `Skip Subdirs`
> column on SOURCES.md. Example: `crafted` declares `Skip Subdirs: describe-me`,
> so `_sources/inbox/crafted/describe-me/` and its mirror under `processed/`
> are invisible to this SKILL. `/ztn:bootstrap` reads that path through its own
> contract and is responsible for moving consumed inbox-side describe-me content
> to the processed-side mirror.

### 2.2 File Selection

All files in `_sources/inbox/` are candidates for processing.

If `--file <path>`: process only that file (can be in inbox or processed).
If `--reprocess`: also scan `_sources/processed/` and re-process specified files.

### 2.3 Sort Chronologically

Sort new files by timestamp ASCENDING (oldest first). Extract the timestamp
from the folder name (for `dir-per-item` / `dir-with-summary` layouts) or
the file name / mtime (for `flat-md`).

Folder-name forms accepted (all may coexist within one source):

1. **Pure ISO** — `2026-04-29T14:09:30Z` → use as-is.
2. **ISO + topic suffix** — `2026-04-29T14:09:30Z_short topic` → split on first `_`, parse left side.
3. **Date + topic** — `2026-04-29_short-topic` → midnight UTC of that date.
4. **Legacy short date + topic** — `04-29 short topic` → assume current year, midnight UTC, surface a CLARIFICATION (`type: source-folder-naming`) so the owner can rename.
5. **No parseable date** → fall back to file mtime, surface a CLARIFICATION suggesting a rename. Never silently drop the file.

Chronological order matters: earlier transcripts provide context for later ones —
within a batch via shared subagent context, across batches via the pre-scan
briefing (see §3.0.1, §3.0.3).

If 0 new files found: report "No new transcripts to process" and exit.
If `--dry-run`: list new files with timestamps, then STOP.

### 2.4 Move to Processed (before processing)

For each file to be processed:
1. Move from `_sources/inbox/{source}/{id}/` to `_sources/processed/{source}/{id}/`
2. This ensures `source:` fields in created notes point to the FINAL file location immediately
3. If processing fails after move, crash recovery detects: file in `processed/` but NOT in PROCESSED.md → needs processing

This "move-first" approach guarantees:
- `source:` fields are always correct (no temporary mismatch)
- New deliveries to `inbox/` won't be confused with in-progress files
- PROCESSED.md entry = fully processed; no entry = needs processing or retry

---

## Step 3: Process Files (per-batch full-pipeline subagents)

### Architecture

The orchestrator partitions the chronologically-sorted file list (from §2.3)
into batches and dispatches one full-pipeline subagent per batch. Each
subagent runs Steps 3.1–3.7 (read → classify → produce notes → structural
verify → self-review) for every transcript in its batch, in shared context.

Steps that REMAIN in the orchestrator and run AFTER all subagents complete:
3.7.5 (constitution alignment), 3.8 (people profiles), 3.9 (system updates),
3.10 (source integrity), and Steps 4.x / 5.x.

**Why this topology:** trust unit = «Opus + sufficient context for the work
unit». Per-batch subagent gives every transcript dedicated attention without
batch-saturation pressure on the orchestrator. Cross-transcript context
within a batch is preserved (full prior transcripts are in the same
subagent context, not summaries).

### 3.0.1 Batch Partitioning

- **Order:** chronological, by source timestamp (filename-derived) — never
  reordered. Order is preserved both within and across batches.
- **Token threshold T = 250 000** input tokens per batch (sum of all
  transcript file contents in the batch, before briefing overhead).
- **Transcript cap N = 6** per batch — secondary limit, even if T not
  reached. Caps attention dilution within shared context.
- **Algorithm:** scan files in chronological order. Pack into current batch
  while both (a) cumulative tokens ≤ T AND (b) transcript count < N. When
  either breaks, close current batch, start a new one with the next file.
  Under-filled batches are acceptable — chronological priority over packing
  density.
- **Oversize edge case:** single source > T → solo batch with that source
  alone. No splitting. Opus 1M context handles it.

### 3.0.2 Concurrency

- Max **3 parallel subagents** at any time.
- If batch count > 3, queue remaining FIFO.
- All subagents within a wave dispatched in a single tool-use message
  (multiple parallel `Task` blocks).

### 3.0.3 Subagent Invocation Contract

- Tool: `Task`, `subagent_type: general-purpose` (inherits Opus from
  orchestrator).
- Per-batch input passed in the Task prompt:
  - **Briefing (verbatim):** pre-scan results from Step 0 — PEOPLE.md,
    PROJECTS.md, HUB_INDEX.md, OPEN_THREADS, principle-candidates buffer
    state. Identical across all subagents in the same run.
  - **Batch transcripts:** ordered list of absolute paths to source files
    in `_sources/processed/...`, in chronological order.
  - **Pipeline spec:** instruction to execute Steps 3.1–3.7 for every
    transcript in the batch. The subagent reads the full transcript
    content from each path and processes them sequentially in chronological
    order, sharing context across them within the batch.
- Subagent return value (manifest):
  ```yaml
  batch_id: "{orchestrator-assigned}"
  transcripts_processed:        # one entry per transcript
    - path: "_sources/processed/..."
      records_created: ["_records/meetings/...", "_records/observations/..."]
      knowledge_notes_created: ["1_projects/..."]
      tasks_extracted: [...]
      events_extracted: [...]
      people_mentions: [...]    # raw, unresolved (orchestrator handles 3.8)
      project_mentions: [...]
      coverage_manifest: {...}  # per §3.7 — see below
      fixes_applied: [...]      # what self-review caught and fixed
      processing_log: [...]     # key decisions for debug/audit visibility
  errors: [...]                 # empty if all transcripts processed cleanly
  ```
- Subagents write produced notes to disk directly (records, knowledge notes,
  hub updates inside their scope). Subagents **do NOT** write to global
  registries (PEOPLE.md, PROJECTS.md, TAGS.md, HUB_INDEX.md,
  PROCESSED.md, log_process.md, TASKS.md, CALENDAR.md) — those are
  orchestrator-only at Steps 3.8, 3.9, 4.x.

### 3.0.4 File Completeness Invariant (hard guarantee)

- Before dispatch: orchestrator computes set `S` = all source paths
  enumerated in §2.4 (after move to `_sources/processed/`).
- After all subagents return: union of `transcripts_processed[].path`
  across all manifests must equal `S` exactly.
- Mismatch (any file missing OR any duplicate processing) → **halt**.
  No partial writes to global registries, no batch artifacts written.
  Surface explicit error in report. Counter `sources` checked against
  `len(S)` at Step 5 Completion Gate.
- Any subagent returning a non-empty `errors` list → halt.

### 3.0.5 Equal-Attention Invariant

- Single subagent prompt template applies to every batch. No fast-path for
  short transcripts, no thorough-path for long ones.
- Within a batch, subagent is instructed to give every transcript identical
  processing depth (Steps 3.1–3.7 in full per transcript) and return
  outputs in the same order as input.

### Steps that follow per transcript inside the subagent

For each transcript in the batch (in chronological order, shared context):
execute Steps 3.1 → 3.6 → 3.7 (self-review) sequentially. After each
transcript, the subagent carries forward a brief running context (3–5
sentences: entities, decisions, open threads) to the next transcript in
the same batch — this is now natural shared-context continuation, not an
explicit handoff document.

### 3.1 Read Transcript

Read full file content. The selected file (per §2.1 layout rule) is one of two formats — same contract regardless of source ID:

- **`transcript_with_summary.md`** (combined): raw transcript + LLM summary in a single file, separated by the literal token `<transcript_to_summary_delimiter>` on its own line.
  - Split the file on that token. Both halves MUST be used.
  - Part BEFORE the delimiter = raw transcript (the SOURCE OF TRUTH for classification, atomization, quotes).
  - Part AFTER the delimiter = LLM-generated summary (use as classification HINT only — never as authority, never quoted).
  - If the delimiter is missing in a file named `transcript_with_summary.md`, treat the entire file as raw transcript and surface a CLARIFICATION (`type: source-format-anomaly`) so the owner can investigate the producer.
- **`transcript.md`** (raw only): the entire file is raw transcript. No summary, no hint.

For `flat-md` sources the file IS the content — no delimiter expected, no summary contract.

### 3.2 LLM Noise Gate

Ask a single binary question about the transcript content:

> "Is this genuine speech content (a real conversation, reflection, or dictation)
> or is it noise (accidental recording, audio artifacts, unintelligible fragments,
> system test output)?"

- **Genuine** → proceed to Step 3.3
- **Noise** → skip this file. Log: `SKIPPED (noise): {path} — {reason}`
  Do NOT add to PROCESSED.md (so it can be re-evaluated if the noise gate
  was wrong — the file stays "new" until genuinely processed).
- **Inclusion-biased:** if in doubt, classify as genuine and process.

### 3.3 Semantic Context Loading

Before classification, load relevant context for THIS specific transcript:

1. **Resolve people** via the People Resolution Map (from Step 0.2):
   - RESOLVED / NEW → use the assigned ID directly
   - AMBIGUOUS → read full transcript context to attempt resolution.
     If still ambiguous: make best guess, log to CLARIFICATIONS.md

2. **Load matching hubs** (from Step 0.3 signals):
   - Read ONLY "Текущее понимание" section (includes subsections: Ключевые выводы,
     Открытые вопросы, Активные риски)
   - Do NOT load full hub files — prevents context window bloat

3. **Grep related notes** for context:
   - **Recent (last 2-3 weeks):** by matched people/projects/topics.
     Read titles and frontmatter only, not full content.
   - **Topic-deep (any age):** if Q10/Q12 will need to check existing knowledge
     on a specific topic (e.g., for hub threshold counting), grep for knowledge
     notes with matching `topic/` or `project/` tags across all time.
     Read frontmatter only — enough to count and detect evolution.
   - Purpose: detect evolution, avoid redundancy, enable accurate hub threshold checks

4. **Resolve projects** against PROJECTS.md registry

5. **Leverage existing ZTN knowledge** (ADR-017):
   For each topic, consider:
   - Is this NEW information?
   - Is this CONFIRMATION of existing knowledge?
   - Is this CONTRADICTION of existing understanding?
   - Is this EVOLUTION of a previous position?

### 3.4 LLM Classification

Answer these 16 questions for each transcript, using the loaded context.
Be specific and cite evidence from the transcript.

**== SOURCE CLASSIFICATION ==**

1. SOURCE TYPE: What kind of source is this?
   Options: work-meeting | personal-reflection | therapy | idea-brainstorm | mixed
   Evidence: [quote from transcript that supports classification]

2. LANGUAGE: What is the primary language of the transcript?
   (Note content will be written in this language. Section headers follow the language.)

**== CONTENT ANALYSIS ==**

3. KEY TOPICS: List 2-5 main topics discussed.
   For each: [topic] — [one-sentence summary]

4. DECISIONS MADE: List any decisions (explicit OR implicit consensus).
   For each decision:
   a) What was decided
   b) What alternatives were considered (even if not explicitly stated — infer from context)
   c) Who made or influenced the decision
   d) Why this choice (reasoning, constraints)
   e) Scope: FINAL (committed) or TENTATIVE (still open to revision)
   f) Supersedes: does this override a previous decision? If yes, which one?
      Check loaded hubs for prior decisions on the same topic.

   Decision markers to scan for: «решили», «договорились», «будем делать», «выбрали»,
   «утвердили», «отложили», «пока так», «по итогу»
   Implicit consensus markers: repeated agreement, lack of objection to a proposal,
   "ну давай так и сделаем", default acceptance

5. ACTION ITEMS: List any tasks, to-dos, commitments.
   For each: [task] — [who is responsible] — [deadline if mentioned]
   Classify each as ACTION / WAITING / DELEGATE per the rules in SYSTEM_CONFIG.md
   (section "Task Format → Правила классификации"). This classification feeds
   TASKS.md aggregation in Step 4.1 and lets Waiting/Delegate items inherit the
   `@person-id` prefix in the aggregate file.

6. INSIGHTS: List any non-obvious realizations, connections, or understanding shifts.
   For each: [insight] — [what changed in understanding]

7. PEOPLE: List ALL people mentioned with their role/context.
   Scan the ENTIRE transcript for names, diminutives, and references.
   Mark as: [participant] (was in the meeting) or [mentioned] (talked about)
   For new people not in registry: [name] — [role] — [org] — [context]

**== STRUCTURAL DECISIONS ==**

8. SPLITTING: How many distinct knowledge streams exist in this transcript?
   A "knowledge stream" = self-contained topic that deserves its own note.
   Consider: Can this topic be understood WITHOUT the other topics in this transcript?
   - If yes → separate note
   - If no → part of the same note

   For each stream: [topic] — [type: decision/insight/reflection/idea/technical]

9. RECORD: What kind of record fits this transcript?
   Records are MANDATORY for every transcript-grounded source so that knowledge
   notes always anchor to a record-id (wikilink), never to a raw transcript path.

   - SOURCE TYPE = work-meeting → **meeting record** in `_records/meetings/`
     Filename: `YYYYMMDD-meeting-{main-participant}-{topic-slug}.md`
     Body: summary (2-3 sentences), key points (ALL significant — Principle 1),
     decisions, action items, participants, source link.

   - SOURCE TYPE ∈ {personal-reflection, idea-brainstorm, therapy} (solo speaker,
     no meeting context) → **observation record** in `_records/observations/`
     Filename: `YYYYMMDD-observation-{topic-slug}.md`
     Body: speaker, summary (2-3 sentences), key points, mood/context if salient,
     source link. NO decisions / action items sections (those live in knowledge
     notes that link back via `extracted_from:`).

   - SOURCE TYPE = mixed → split into the dominant kind by majority of content,
     or create both a meeting record AND an observation record if two distinct
     transcript segments warrant it. Document the choice in Q9 evidence.

   Output: proposed filename(s), kind, speaker (for observation), summary, key points.

10. KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION: For each knowledge stream from Q8:
    - Should this become a standalone Knowledge Note?
    - Threshold: Does it have VALUE beyond the meeting context?
      (A status update = no. An architectural decision = yes. A career insight = yes.)
    - If yes: proposed filename, folder, types, domains
    - EXISTING KNOWLEDGE CHECK (use Step 3.3 topic-deep grep results):
      Does a note on this exact topic already exist?
      If yes: is this NEW, CONFIRMATION, CONTRADICTION, or EVOLUTION?

11. HUB CONTINUITY: Does this transcript continue/update any existing hub?
    Check loaded hubs. For each match:
    - Hub ID
    - What new information does this transcript add?
    - How does "Текущее понимание" need to change?
    - New entry for Хронологическая карта: [date] [note-ref] [type] [what happened]
    - New entry for Changelog: [date] [what shifted]

12. NEW HUB: Does any topic now reach the 3+ knowledge notes threshold?
    Count existing KNOWLEDGE notes touching this topic (use Step 3.3 topic-deep
    grep results + notes created earlier in this batch). If 3+ including
    this one → propose new hub.
    (Records do NOT count toward the threshold — only knowledge notes.)
    - Proposed hub ID: hub-{topic}
    - Initial "Текущее понимание" draft
    - Backfill хронологическая карта from existing notes

13. CROSS-DOMAIN: Is there anything here that changes understanding in ANOTHER domain?
    Threshold: ~30% confidence. If it MIGHT be relevant → capture the link.
    - [insight from domain A] → [relevance to domain B]
    - Proposed wikilink or hub update

14. CONTENT POTENTIAL: Assess each knowledge stream from Q8 for public sharing value.

    Three fields (all OPTIONAL — omit entirely if no public value):

    #### content_potential: high|medium

    `high` — at least ONE is true:
    - Author shares personal experience/story illustrating a professional principle
    - Specific technical insight, approach, or architectural decision
    - Opinion/position on a topic discussed in the industry (AI, fintech, management, etc.)
    - Career, leadership, or management reflection with concrete examples
    - Business or product idea with an original angle
    - Workflow, process, or tool usage pattern useful to others
    - Personal reflection or life insight with universal resonance

    `medium` — at least ONE is true:
    - Kernel of interesting thought, not yet fully developed
    - Topic is potentially public, but current context is too personal/company-specific — needs rework
    - Fragment that could become part of a larger post when combined with other notes

    #### content_type: expert|reflection|story|insight|observation

    Set when `content_potential` is set. Determines the NATURE of the note (single value):

    | Type | What it is | Example |
    |------|-----------|---------|
    | `expert` | Professional/technical knowledge, architectural decisions, domain expertise | "DBA alias vs merchant profiles" |
    | `reflection` | Personal introspection, psychology, self-analysis, therapy insights | "Валидация и отвержение комплиментов" |
    | `story` | Narrative arc — career journey, personal experience, travel, life event | "From Java Dev to TPM: 9-year journey" |
    | `insight` | Non-obvious connection, counter-intuitive observation, pattern recognition | "AI adoption в QA: творческое сопротивление — не страх замены" |
    | `observation` | Lightweight seed thought, casual noticing, not yet developed | "Music's role in creative thinking" |

    `content_type` is the dominant type of the NOTE, not the post. A therapy reflection
    that can be reframed as a management insight for LinkedIn is still `reflection` —
    the reframing is `/ztn:check-content`'s job when generating drafts.

    #### content_angle: string OR array of strings

    Each angle = one sentence hook — the "why would someone read this?" framing.

    **Single angle** (most notes):
    ```yaml
    content_angle: "Почему делегирование — это не про контроль, а про детский перфекционизм"
    ```

    **Multiple angles** (when a note can produce posts with different framings):
    ```yaml
    content_angle:
      - "Childhood perfectionism → adult control patterns: a therapy insight"
      - "Why delegation is hard for tech leads — it's not about trust"
    ```

    Multiple angles typically arise when a note sits at the intersection of domains
    (personal + professional, technical + management). Each angle may target a different
    audience or platform — `/ztn:check-content` uses angles to cluster the note into
    multiple theme groups and generate distinct drafts.

    **Default: one angle.** Only add multiple when genuinely distinct framings exist.
    Don't force it — one good angle is better than two weak ones.

    #### Bias and filtering

    **Bias: inclusion.** When in doubt, mark `medium`. Do NOT skip.
    Filtering is `/ztn:check-content`'s job, not this step's.
    False positives are cheap; false negatives lose content opportunities.

15. CONCEPTS: Extract every meaningful "thing-in-the-world" mentioned that
    warrants a node in the knowledge graph. Concepts span themes, tools,
    decision classes, ideas, events, organizations, skills, locations,
    emotions, goals, values, preferences, constraints, algorithms, facts,
    other. **People and projects are NOT concepts here** — they have
    first-class channels (`people:` / `projects:` frontmatter,
    `tier1_objects.{people,projects}` in manifest); do NOT duplicate.

    **Translation rule (HARD, non-negotiable).** Source language can be
    Russian, English, or mixed. Concept names emit in **English snake_case
    only** per `_system/registries/CONCEPT_NAMING.md`. When the source
    uses a non-English term, **translate semantically at extraction**:

    - «реструктуризация команды» → `team_restructuring` ✓
    - «приоритизация очереди» → `queue_prioritization` ✓
    - «ежедневник» → `daily_planner` ✓
    - «делегирование как контроль» → `delegation_control_pattern` ✓

    NEVER transliterate (would split graph identity across languages):

    - «реструктуризация» → `restrukturizatsiya` ✗
    - «делегирование» → `delegirovanie` ✗

    **The translation contract is the only contract.** There is no
    mechanical transliteration-detector — the LLM (you) is always
    available in this pipeline and is the sole resolver. If you slip
    and emit a transliteration, it lands as a phantom graph node
    (`restrukturizatsiya` and the next run's `restrukturisatsia` are
    two distinct identifiers). The cost of one mistake is a split
    node forever; the cost of dropping an untranslatable term is one
    lost mention. Translate or drop — never transliterate.

    **Translation-impossible fallback (autonomous, no owner action).**
    If a term is genuinely untranslatable (cultural/legal/domain jargon
    with no clean English equivalent — `dacha`-class) → **drop the
    entry**, do not emit. Dropping loses one mention but keeps graph
    identity stable (transliterating across mentions would create
    multiple variants of the same node). When multiple plausible
    translations exist, pick the one most consistent with surrounding
    concepts in the same transcript (lexical-context heuristic). Never
    raise a CLARIFICATION; the model is the only resolver.

    **Normalisation (autonomous, run on every emitted name).** Apply
    `_system/scripts/_common.py::normalize_concept_name()` heuristic:
    diacritic-fold → lowercase → separator→`_` → collapse runs → trim
    `_` → drop if non-ASCII residue → drop if charset fails → strip
    forbidden type prefix → drop if empty after strip → truncate at
    last `_` boundary `≤ 64`. The function returns `None` when
    normalisation cannot produce a valid identifier; callers MUST
    treat `None` as «skip silently». Forbidden type prefixes (auto-
    stripped, not raised): `theme_`, `decision_`, `person_`,
    `project_`, `tool_`, `idea_`, `event_`, `goal_`, `value_`, `fact_`,
    `organization_`, `skill_`, `location_`, `emotion_`, `preference_`,
    `constraint_`, `algorithm_`, `other_`. Type lives in metadata,
    not in name.

    **Selectivity (Rule 8).** Reject broad classifiers — if a name
    would match half the corpus (`work`, `general`, `meetings`), it's
    a domain or tag, not a concept. Reject sentence-fragments that
    only describe one specific moment (`q3_2026_team_offsite_notes`)
    — extract the load-bearing noun (`team_restructuring`) instead.
    The selectivity test: would this name plausibly recur across
    multiple future notes that the owner would want to link?

    **For each emitted concept, capture metadata for the manifest:**

    | Field | Required | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | `name` | yes | Canonical snake_case identifier |
    | `type` | yes | One of (lowercase): `theme`, `tool`, `decision`, `idea`, `event`, `organization`, `skill`, `location`, `emotion`, `goal`, `value`, `preference`, `constraint`, `algorithm`, `fact`, `other`. **NOT** `person` / `project`. |
    | `subtype` | optional | Finer category within type (e.g. type=`tool`, subtype=`database`). Same snake_case format. |
    | `related_concepts` | optional | Other concepts mentioned alongside this one in the same transcript context. Same snake_case format on every entry. |
    | `previous_slugs` | optional | Past names this concept was known by — chain via this field on rename. Same snake_case format. |

    **Output for downstream steps:**

    - **Per record:** the canonical concept-name list will populate
      the record's `concepts:` frontmatter (Step 3.5 §A) and the
      manifest's `records.created[].concept_hints[]` (Step 4 batch
      assembly).
    - **Per knowledge note:** subset of the parent record's concepts
      that this specific knowledge stream covers — populates the
      note's `concepts:` frontmatter and the manifest's
      `knowledge_notes.created[].concept_hints[]`.
    - **Per hub touched:** union of `concepts:` from member knowledge
      notes — populates the manifest's `hubs.{updated|created}[].member_concepts[]`
      at emission time. Hub frontmatter does NOT carry `concepts:`
      (would invite drift between hub field and member-aggregate);
      the field is manifest-only.
    - **Batch level:** every distinct concept emitted across the run
      → one entry in `concepts.upserts[]` with `name` + `type` +
      optional `subtype` / `related_concepts` / `previous_slugs`.
      Deduplicated by `name` (case-folded snake_case is canonical).
      Two notes mentioning `org_structure` → ONE upsert entry; their
      consolidated `related_concepts` is the union.

    **Edge cases:**

    - **Acronyms / versions:** lowercase wins (`oauth`, not `o_auth`;
      `api_v2`, not `api_v_2`). Treat acronym as one segment.
    - **Subtype vs separate concept:** if the would-be subtype could
      stand on its own and be referenced by other notes (`vector_database`
      as its own concept), make it a separate concept with a
      `related_concepts` link instead of a subtype. Subtype is only
      for "this particular tool happens to be of subtype X."
    - **Compound names:** if parts mean meaningfully different things,
      split into multiple concepts. If the long form is a context-
      sentence dressed as an identifier, pick the load-bearing noun.

16. PRIVACY TRIO (origin / audience_tags / is_sensitive): Decide privacy
    fields for every entity emitted in this transcript pass — record(s),
    each knowledge note, hubs touched, person profiles created/updated,
    project profiles, tasks, events, ideas. The trio is **slot-only at
    this layer**: this skill emits values; downstream consumers (Minder
    backend, sync targets) apply policy.

    **HARD invariant — fail closed.** Defaults are chosen so that absence
    of inference yields owner-only access (`audience_tags: []`). The
    inclusion-bias from Principle 1 does NOT apply here — false-positive
    audience inference leaks content. When uncertain, leave `[]`.

    **`origin` (single value):**

    | Value | When |
    |---|---|
    | `personal` | SOURCE TYPE (Q1) ∈ {personal-reflection, idea-brainstorm, therapy}. Solo Plaud captures. Family / health / life-decision content. **Default when ambiguous.** |
    | `work` | SOURCE TYPE = work-meeting. Content explicitly about work projects, work team, work decisions. Mixed transcripts where the dominant content is work-context. |
    | `external` | Content extracted from external sources (clipped articles, third-party documents, AI-generated profile summaries). Rare in `/ztn:process` since `Skip Subdirs` typically excludes external reference. |

    Mixed transcripts: pick the dominant context for the record's
    origin; per-knowledge-note `origin` is set independently per the
    note's content (a personal-reflection knowledge note extracted
    from a work-meeting record can carry `origin: personal`).

    **`audience_tags` (list, conservative):**

    Default `[]` (owner-only) unless content shows **clear, explicit**
    sharing intent. Set tags only when:

    | Tag | Trigger |
    |---|---|
    | `[work]` | Owner explicitly says they will share with the work team (status update for standup, decision draft to communicate, doc draft for the team), OR content_potential note where content_type aligns with internal work audience. |
    | `[professional-network]` | Content has clear LinkedIn-grade voice (career / leadership / management insight ready for public-professional audience). content_potential=high notes with content_type ∈ {expert, insight} typically land here. |
    | `[friends]` | Content explicitly framed for friend circle (stoic reflection meant to share, friend-circle decision). |
    | `[family]` | Content explicitly framed for family (family decision, vacation plan). |
    | `[world]` | Content explicitly meant for public broadcast (Twitter / public blog draft). |

    **content_potential mapping (Q14 → Q16):**

    - `content_potential: high` + `content_type: expert | insight`
      → `[professional-network]` is a reasonable default
    - `content_potential: high` + `content_type: reflection | story`
      → `[professional-network]` if owner has shared similar before
        (visible in `_system/POSTS.md` history); else `[]` — let
        `/ztn:check-content` decide at draft time
    - `content_potential: medium` or `observation` → `[]` — still
      seed-stage; widening is owner's call later
    - No content_potential → `[]`

    **Multiple tags allowed** (`[work, friends]`) when the audience
    genuinely overlaps. Flat union, no hierarchy.

    **Unknown / extension tags (autonomous resolution).** If you'd
    want to set a tag NOT in the canonical 5 AND NOT in
    `_system/registries/AUDIENCES.md` Extensions table → silently drop
    that tag and emit `audience_tags: []` for the entity. The
    fail-closed default is the right outcome on any uncertainty —
    false-positive sharing leaks; false-negative just keeps content
    owner-only. Never coin a new tag, never raise CLARIFICATION; the
    AUDIENCES Extensions table is owner-curated outside the
    `/ztn:process` pipeline. **Heuristic mapping before drop:** if the
    intended audience semantically maps to a canonical (e.g. "team" →
    `work`, "linkedin" → `professional-network`, "tweet" → `world`),
    use the canonical. Only drop when no canonical applies.

    **`is_sensitive` (bool):**

    Set `true` if content matches ANY:

    - NDA / confidential mention («под NDA», «не для разглашения»,
      «конфиденциально», "off the record")
    - Salary / compensation / equity / specific financial detail
      (specific amounts, comp packages, equity grants, debt detail)
    - Health / medical detail (diagnoses, conditions, medications,
      mental-health specifics — beyond "feeling tired")
    - Family conflict, intimate relationship detail (specific
      grievances, emotional disclosures involving named family /
      partners)
    - Reputational risk content (specific allegations about named
      people, legal-risk topics)

    `false` otherwise. **`is_sensitive: true` does NOT narrow
    `audience_tags`** — they're orthogonal. A work memo can be
    `audience_tags=[work], is_sensitive=true` (team can see it; share
    outside requires friction). Health note for spouse:
    `audience_tags=[family], is_sensitive=true`.

    **Per-entity application table:**

    | Entity | origin | audience_tags | is_sensitive |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Record (meeting / observation) | from SOURCE TYPE | `[]` unless explicit sharing intent | per content scan |
    | Knowledge note | independent of parent record (a personal-reflection note from a work-meeting record can be `personal`) | per content_potential mapping above; default `[]` | per content scan |
    | Hub touched | inherit dominant member-note `origin` | `[]` (owner curates by hand) | `false` unless any member note is sensitive |
    | Person profile (new / updated) | inherit from creating record (work-meeting → `work`; personal-reflection → `personal`) | `[]` always | `false` unless owner-curated content is sensitive |
    | Project profile (new) | from project's actual context — work-employment project → `work`, personal side-project → `personal`, external/clipped → `external` (NOT hardcoded `work`) | `[]` | `false` |
    | Task | inherit from parent note | inherit from parent note | inherit from parent note |
    | Event | inherit from parent note | inherit from parent note | inherit from parent note |
    | Idea note | per content scan | `[]` (ideas are seed-stage) | per content scan |

### 3.5 Create Outputs

Based on the 16-question classification, create outputs. Fully automatic, no confirmation needed.

#### A) Records → RECORD in `_records/{kind}/`

Create exactly one record per transcript. Two kinds:

##### A1) Work meetings → `_records/meetings/`

Filename: `YYYYMMDD-meeting-{main-participant}-{topic-slug}.md`
Template: `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/templates/record-template.md`

Frontmatter: `layer: record`, `kind: meeting` (omit `kind` for backward compat —
absence implies meeting; new records SHOULD include it explicitly).

**Concept + privacy fields (mandatory on every new record).** Add to
frontmatter from Q15 / Q16 outputs:

- `concepts:` — list of canonical concept-name strings mentioned in
  this transcript per Q15. Empty list `[]` allowed when no concept
  cleared the selectivity bar (Rule 8). All entries snake_case ASCII
  per `_system/registries/CONCEPT_NAMING.md`. People and projects do
  NOT go here.
- `origin:` — `work` (default for meeting records, consistent with
  SOURCE TYPE = work-meeting). Override only when Q16 inferred
  otherwise.
- `audience_tags:` — `[]` by default (owner-only). Set canonical tag
  ONLY on explicit sharing intent per Q16.
- `is_sensitive:` — boolean per Q16 sensitivity scan.

Record contains:
- Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Ключевые пункты (bullets — ALL significant points, not just "important" ones.
  Principle 1: Capture First. Even a one-line mention of Georgian clients goes in.)
- Решения (with rationale — from Q4 enhanced format)
- Action Items (with `- [ ]`, person link `[[person-id]]`, `^task-{slug}`)
- Упоминания людей (with context: role in this meeting, participant vs mentioned)
- `## Source` section with relative path to raw transcript

NO `<details>` blocks. NO raw transcript duplication. The `## Source` section
links to `_sources/processed/` for full-text access.

##### A2) Solo transcripts → `_records/observations/`

Use for personal-reflection / idea-brainstorm / therapy / any single-speaker
Plaud capture where there is no meeting to log. The observation record is the
canonical anchor for any knowledge notes extracted from this transcript — it
is what their `extracted_from:` and `## Evidence Trail` wikilink points to.

Filename: `YYYYMMDD-observation-{topic-slug}.md`
Template: `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/templates/observation-record-template.md`

Frontmatter:
```yaml
---
id: YYYYMMDD-observation-{topic-slug}
title: "Наблюдение: {topic on transcript language}"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
source: _sources/processed/{source}/{timestamp}/transcript_with_summary.md
recorded_at: {ISO timestamp from transcript folder name, when known}

layer: record
kind: observation
speaker: {person-id of the owner from SOUL.md Identity; "unknown" if ambiguous}
people:
  - {anyone mentioned by name}
projects:
  - {projects touched if any}
concepts:
  - {snake_case concept name from Q15 — translated, normalised, selective}
origin: {personal | work | external — from Q16; default personal for solo capture}
audience_tags: []
is_sensitive: {true | false — from Q16 sensitivity scan; therapy / health / family content typically true}
tags:
  - record/observation
  - person/{speaker}
  - topic/{key-topic}
---
```

Body:
- `## Summary` — 2-3 sentences capturing what the recording was about
- `## Ключевые пункты` — bullets covering ALL significant points (same Principle 1)
- `## Контекст / настроение` — optional: where/when/mood if salient (e.g., «в машине после встречи с Димой», «после терапии»)
- `## Упоминания людей` — only if names came up (otherwise omit)
- `## Source` — transcript path, recorded timestamp

NO `## Решения` / `## Action Items` sections. Decisions and tasks belong in
knowledge notes, where they earn their own structure and link back via
`extracted_from: {observation-record-id}`.

##### Routing summary

| SOURCE TYPE (Q1)                                | Record kind | Folder                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| work-meeting                                    | meeting     | `_records/meetings/`    |
| personal-reflection / idea-brainstorm / therapy | observation | `_records/observations/`|
| mixed                                           | both kinds  | split per dominant segment |

#### B) Knowledge streams → KNOWLEDGE NOTE in PARA folders

For each knowledge stream identified in Q8/Q10:

Filename mapping by primary type:
- decision → `YYYYMMDD-decision-{topic}.md`
- insight → `YYYYMMDD-insight-{topic}.md`
- reflection → `YYYYMMDD-reflection-{topic}.md`
- idea → `YYYYMMDD-idea-{topic}.md`
- technical → `YYYYMMDD-technical-{topic}.md`

Folder: use routing logic from SYSTEM_CONFIG.md (Folder Routing Logic section).
Template: `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/templates/note-template.md`

Frontmatter MUST include `layer: knowledge`.
If extracted from a record: add `extracted_from: {record-id}` to frontmatter.
`contains:` block is OPTIONAL — include only if note has tasks or ideas.

**Concept + privacy fields (mandatory on every new knowledge note).**

- `concepts:` — list of canonical concept-name strings this knowledge
  note covers. Subset of the parent record's `concepts:` list, narrowed
  to what *this specific knowledge stream* is about (per Q15 →
  per-knowledge-note allocation). Each entry snake_case ASCII, English
  only, normalised per CONCEPT_NAMING. Empty list `[]` allowed when no
  concept clears Rule 8 selectivity. People / projects do NOT go here.
- `origin:` — set independently of the parent record. A
  personal-reflection knowledge note extracted from a work-meeting
  record can be `origin: personal` if the content is genuinely
  personal-context. Default: inherit parent record's `origin`.
- `audience_tags:` — `[]` by default. Set per Q16 mapping including
  the content_potential → audience-tag rule (high+expert/insight →
  `[professional-network]`; high+reflection/story → conditional;
  medium / observation → `[]`).
- `is_sensitive:` — boolean per Q16 sensitivity scan applied to this
  note's specific content (a knowledge note can be more or less
  sensitive than its parent record).

**`description:` field — mandatory for new knowledge notes.** One-line
summary (≤100 chars) of what the note is about. Used by `/ztn:maintain`
Step 7.6 to render the INDEX.md catalog. Distinct from `title:`:
- `title:` names the note («Стратегический разбор встречи с Василием»)
- `description:` describes its content («Решение перейти к ежемесячным
  планам, а не квартальным; reasoning по 1-1 cadence»)

If the LLM cannot draft a meaningful description in one short line, it
SHOULD still write a fallback derived from `## Ключевая мысль` truncated
to 100 chars rather than omitting the field. INDEX.md fallback chain
(description → title → first prose line → `_(no description)_`) tolerates
omission, but legacy notes already have no `description:` and the goal of
this field is to phase that out for new content.

If Q14 determined content_potential for this knowledge stream:
  - Add `content_potential: high` or `content_potential: medium` to frontmatter (after `priority:`)
  - Add `content_type: {type}` — one of: expert, reflection, story, insight, observation
  - Add `content_angle:` — string (one angle) or array (multiple distinct framings)
  - All three fields are OPTIONAL — omit entirely if Q14 found no public value

Decision notes (ADR-013 enhanced):
- Body includes: what was decided, alternatives considered, reasoning, who decided, scope
- If superseding a previous decision: add `supersedes: {previous-note-id}` to frontmatter
- The superseded note is NOT modified — both versions persist (Principle 5: Evolution Tracking)

#### Idea Notes — Living Document Pattern

When a knowledge stream's primary type is `idea`:

1. **SEARCH** existing ideas before creating a new file:
   - Grep `3_resources/ideas/business/` and `3_resources/ideas/products/` frontmatter
   - Match signals (all contribute to confidence):
     a) Tag overlap: compare `topic/*` and `project/*` tags (weight: 40%)
     b) Title/keyword overlap: extract 2-4 key words from new idea title,
        compare against existing titles and aliases (weight: 35%)
     c) Subfolder match: same subfolder (business/ or products/) adds base score (weight: 25%)

2. **Decision thresholds:**
   - **≥ 80% confidence — MATCH:** Update the existing idea note:
     - READ existing note
     - APPEND section: `## Update YYYY-MM-DD` with: source link, new context, what changed/evolved
     - Update `modified:` date in frontmatter
     - Increment `mentions:` count (add field if missing, default to 1 for existing notes)
     - Add additional source to `## Source` section
     - Do NOT create a new file
   - **50-79% confidence — AMBIGUOUS:** Create new note (safe default).
     Add `mentions: 1`. Log to CLARIFICATIONS.md:
     "New idea [{title}] may be related to existing [[{existing-id}]]. Consider merging."
   - **< 50% confidence — NO MATCH:** Create new idea note as before.
     Add `mentions: 1` to frontmatter.

3. **Edge cases:**
   - Multiple matches ≥ 80%: pick highest confidence, log runner-ups to CLARIFICATIONS
   - Cross-subfolder match (business↔products): treat as AMBIGUOUS regardless of score

Body structure for knowledge notes:
- ## Контекст — where/when this came up
- ## Ключевая мысль — the core insight/decision/idea (with `^insight-{slug}` anchor if needed)
- ## Применение / Следствие — so what? how does this change things?
- ## Связи — `[[wikilinks]]` to related notes, hubs, people
- ## Evidence Trail — append-only audit trail of knowledge (see below)
- ## Source — link to raw transcript

#### Evidence Trail (mandatory for new knowledge notes)

Every new knowledge note (`layer: knowledge`, any type: decision / insight / reflection /
idea / technical) MUST include a `## Evidence Trail` section placed **before** `## Source`.
Records (`layer: record`) and people profiles do NOT get Evidence Trail.

Format:

```markdown
## Evidence Trail

- **YYYY-MM-DD** | [[{source-record-or-note-id}]] — {≤1-2 sentences: what was extracted / confirmed / contradicted / raised}
```

Rules:
1. **Initial entry (N ≥ 1)** on creation:
   - Typically 1 entry — the source record/transcript this note was extracted from.
   - 2+ entries when the note has multiple origins (e.g., `extracted_from:` + explicit `related_to:` references that point at other source records in the same batch).
2. **Ordering:** newest-first. New entries prepended at the top of the list.
3. **Append-only:** never delete or rewrite entries. Corrections land as new entries noting the previous one was inaccurate.
4. **Matching is limited to `type: idea` Living Document pattern.** For other types, a new transcript that touches the same topic produces a new note (linked via `supersedes:` / `related_to:`) with its own initial Evidence Trail — NOT an append to the existing note's Trail. Rich matching for decision / insight / reflection / technical is `/ztn:lint` territory.
5. **Legacy notes without Evidence Trail are valid.** Never backfill existing notes via `/ztn:process` — that is `/ztn:lint` territory through CLARIFICATIONS suggestions.
6. **Multiple `## Evidence Trail` sections in one file** (anomaly, e.g., human edit): append to the first section encountered. Do NOT merge or delete the others. Raise an item in `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` `## Open Items` with type `evidence-trail-anomaly` (and this increments `clarifications_raised`).

#### Idea Living Document — Evidence Trail append + dedup

Extension of the Living Document pattern above (≥ 80% match branch):

- After reading the existing idea note and before writing, **prepend** a new entry to its `## Evidence Trail` section:
  `- **{today}** | [[{new-source-id}]] — {1-2 sentence summary of what this transcript adds}`
- **Dedup by (date + source-id):** if the existing Trail already contains an entry with the same date AND same `[[source-id]]`, **skip the prepend** (do NOT create a duplicate). This makes `--reprocess` idempotent and protects against re-run dirt.
- All other Living Document side effects (Update section, `modified:`, `mentions:`, additional Source link) remain as before.

#### `--reprocess` semantics for Evidence Trail

- **Decision / insight / reflection / technical / initial idea:** the note is fully rewritten by the reprocess run → the Evidence Trail is **reset** → write exactly one fresh initial entry with the reprocess date and the source link. Prior Trail history is discarded (it reflected a classification we are deliberately revising).
- **Idea via Living Document update during `--reprocess`:** apply the same (date + source-id) dedup described above. If the source is already present in the Trail → skip the prepend. This makes `--reprocess` idempotent at the Trail level.
- **Legacy notes without Evidence Trail** that the skill did NOT create: untouched. Backfill is `/ztn:lint` territory.

For personal content (reflections, therapy, ideas):
- Write in the language of the original transcript
- Preserve texture: direct quotes with `> "цитата"`, emotional context, narrative arc
- No record created — only knowledge notes

Primary note: When N knowledge notes come from one transcript, all reference
the source via `source:` in frontmatter. The primary note (closest to the main
topic) is first. Others include `related_to: {primary-note-id}` in frontmatter
(analogous to `extracted_from` and `supersedes` — relationship metadata belongs
in frontmatter, not content).

#### C) Hub updates → UPDATE existing hub in `5_meta/mocs/`

For each matching hub (from Q11):
1. Read current hub file
2. REWRITE "Текущее понимание" — integrate new information with existing understanding.
   This is a FULL REWRITE of the section, reflecting the latest synthesized state.
   Written in first person, as a summary for future self.
3. ADD row to "Хронологическая карта" — date, `[[note-ref|title]]`, type, what happened
4. ADD entries to "Связанные знания" — decisions, insights, cross-domain links
5. ADD entry to "Changelog" (newest first) — date + what shifted in understanding
6. Update `modified` date in frontmatter
7. Update `people`, `projects` lists if new entries

**Hub privacy + member_concepts on update (autonomous, owner edits
preserved via explicit marker).** Hub frontmatter does NOT gain a
`concepts:` field — `member_concepts[]` lives only in the manifest,
derived at emission time (Step 4.7). Privacy trio on hub frontmatter
(`origin` / `audience_tags` / `is_sensitive`) is derived by the
deterministic helper `_system/scripts/_common.py::recompute_hub_trio()`.
Derivation rules:

- `origin` ← dominant `origin` across member knowledge notes; tie →
  `personal` (conservative default).
- `audience_tags` ← intersection of member-note `audience_tags[]`
  (only audiences ALL members agree on widen the hub; default `[]`).
  Intersection, not union — fail-closed across members.
- `is_sensitive` ← `true` if ANY member is sensitive, else `false`.
  Sensitivity is contagious upward.

**Owner-vs-engine ownership contract.** Hub frontmatter carries an
`_engine_derived: [field, ...]` list that names the trio fields the
engine currently owns:

- Field NOT in frontmatter → engine derives, writes value, ADDS field
  name to `_engine_derived`. (Fresh hub: all three engine-owned;
  membership changes flow through automatically on every touch.)
- Field IN frontmatter AND name IN `_engine_derived` → engine
  RE-DERIVES on every touch. New members shift dominant origin →
  hub follows; owner doesn't have to babysit.
- Field IN frontmatter AND name NOT IN `_engine_derived` → owner
  edit. Engine NEVER touches.

**To take over a field as owner:** remove the field name from
`_engine_derived`. The current value stays as the owner's authoritative
choice. To re-engage the engine on that field: add the name back to
`_engine_derived` (or just delete the field — engine re-derives + re-marks
on next run).

**Backward compatibility.** Hubs created before the marker existed
have trio fields without `_engine_derived`. The engine treats those
as owner-set (preserves them) — matching the legacy "set once, owner
takes over" semantics. New derivations on those hubs grow the marker
incrementally; over time the hub transitions to the explicit model.

The manifest emission step (4.7) reads the post-recompute frontmatter
values verbatim. No CLARIFICATIONs at any point.

#### D) New hub creation → CREATE in `5_meta/mocs/`

When a topic reaches 3+ KNOWLEDGE notes (Q12):
1. Use template: `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/templates/hub-template.md`
2. Fill "Текущее понимание" — synthesize from all related notes
3. BACKFILL "Хронологическая карта" — rows for ALL existing related notes
4. Fill "Связанные знания" — decisions, insights, questions
5. Fill "Changelog" — initial entry
6. Add to `_system/views/HUB_INDEX.md`

Hub ID format: `hub-{topic-slug}` (e.g., `hub-api-platform`, `hub-delegation-pattern`)

**New hub privacy trio on creation.** Same helper
(`_common.py::recompute_hub_trio`), same rules: dominant origin,
audience intersection, sensitivity contagion. On a fresh hub all
three fields are missing → derivation fills all three. Subsequent
touches preserve any owner edits per the same owner-edit
preservation contract.

#### E) Cross-domain insights

If significant enough (from Q13):
- Create standalone knowledge note in the TARGET domain
- Link back to source note and source domain hub
- Update target domain hub if it exists

If minor:
- Add `[[wikilink]]` in source note's "Связи" section
- Mention in hub's "Связанные знания → Cross-Domain" section

### 3.6 Structural Verification

After creating EACH note (record or knowledge), verify:

- [ ] Frontmatter is valid YAML — no syntax errors, all required fields present
- [ ] `layer:` field is correct — `record` for records, `knowledge` for knowledge notes
- [ ] People IDs in `people:` exist in PEOPLE.md OR will be created in Step 3.8
- [ ] Project IDs in `projects:` exist in PROJECTS.md
- [ ] Tags follow conventions from TAGS.md (format: `type/xxx`, `domain/xxx`, etc.)
- [ ] File placed in correct PARA folder per SYSTEM_CONFIG.md routing rules
- [ ] `source:` points to a real file path in `_sources/processed/`
- [ ] `extracted_from:` (if present) references an existing or just-created record ID
- [ ] `supersedes:` (if present) references an existing note ID
- [ ] ID matches filename (without `.md` extension)
- [ ] `concepts:` field present (list, possibly empty `[]`). Each entry passed through `normalize_concept_name()`; non-conformant raw values are silently rewritten to the canonical normalised form; entries that cannot be normalised are silently dropped. **Never halt; never CLARIFICATION** — autonomous resolution per the engine doctrine for the concept layer.
- [ ] `origin:` field present — value ∈ {`personal`, `work`, `external`}. Missing / unknown value → coerce to `personal` silently (the conservative default).
- [ ] `audience_tags:` field present (list, possibly empty `[]`). Each entry passed through `normalize_audience_tag()`; result accepted only if it matches canonical 5 OR an Extensions row in `_system/registries/AUDIENCES.md`; otherwise silently dropped. Final list may collapse to `[]` — that is the correct fail-closed outcome.
- [ ] `is_sensitive:` field present — boolean. String `"true"` / `"false"` coerced silently; any other type coerced to `false`.

If any check fails, fix immediately before proceeding.

### 3.7 Self-Review (subagent-internal coverage check)

**Runs inside the subagent**, per transcript, **after** §3.6 structural
verification, **before** the subagent moves to the next transcript or
returns its manifest. NON-OPTIONAL. Every transcript must produce a
coverage manifest.

**Purpose:** producer-side completion ritual. The subagent has just
processed a transcript and produced notes — before declaring done, it
re-anchors itself to the source one more time through the four scan
lenses, generates an explicit coverage manifest, and reconciles the
manifest against its own produced notes. Mismatches are fixed in place.

**Trust model:** this is producer-trust under «Opus + full context», not
external verifier-redundancy. The subagent is the authority on its own
output; self-review is the explicit finishing step that ensures every
transcript got the four-lens treatment uniformly. Limitation acknowledged:
shared blind spots between the main pass and the self-review pass cannot
be caught here — that is the cost of the producer-trust model.

#### 3.7.1 Generate coverage manifest

For the current transcript, anchor back to the **raw transcript content**
(skip any LLM-generated summary section in `transcript_with_summary.md`)
and produce four lenses:

a) PEOPLE SCAN: every person name, diminutive, or contextual reference
   («мой техлид», «тот парень из QA»). For each: participant or mentioned?

b) TOPIC SCAN: every topic shift or subject change. For each: one-sentence
   summary of what was discussed.

c) DECISION SCAN: every decision marker.
   Explicit: «решили», «договорились», «будем делать», «выбрали», «утвердили»,
   «отложили», «пока так», «по итогу».
   Implicit: agreement without objection, «ну давай так», default acceptance.
   For each: what was decided, by whom, with what reasoning?

d) ACTION SCAN: every commitment marker.
   «сделаю», «до пятницы», «надо будет», «я возьму», «запланирую».
   For each: who committed, to what, by when?

Quote literally where quotes matter. Be exhaustive — completeness here is
the entire value of the step.

#### 3.7.2 Reconcile against produced notes

For each item in the manifest:
- PRESENT in produced note(s) → MATCHED. Verify meaning preserved.
- ABSENT from produced notes → MISSED.

For each claim in the produced notes:
- Anchored to a manifest item or to a clear inference from one → OK.
- No basis in source → HALLUCINATED.

Failure types and fixes (apply in place, before returning):
- **MISSED** — fact in source, absent from note. Add to the note.
- **DISTORTED** — fact in note, meaning changed from source. Correct.
- **HALLUCINATED** — fact in note, no source basis. Remove.
- **THIN DECISION** — decision captured but lacks alternatives/reasoning/scope. Enrich.
- **UNLINKED REVISION** — decision updates a prior one without `supersedes:`. Add link.

#### 3.7.3 Manifest output

Subagent attaches per-transcript to its return manifest:
- `coverage_manifest`: the four scan lists.
- `fixes_applied`: list of `{type, target_note_id, brief}` for every fix.
- If no fixes were needed, `fixes_applied: []` — explicit empty, not omitted.

### 3.7.5 Constitution Alignment Check

For every record produced in this run with `types:` array containing
`decision`, run an alignment check against the active constitution tree.
Records carrying heavy `fixes_applied` from §3.7 self-review (≥ 3 fixes,
or any HALLUCINATED fix) are deferred — content reliability borderline,
do not generate drift clarifications until reviewed.

This step runs in the **orchestrator**, after all subagents complete and
their manifests are aggregated.

**How:** invoke `/ztn:check-decision` per decision record. Pass:

- `situation` = one-sentence distillation of the decision (context + chosen
  path + stated rationale from the record)
- `record_ref` = wiki-link to the record (meeting or observation), e.g. `[[YYYYMMDD-meeting-...]]` or `[[YYYYMMDD-observation-...]]`
- `dry_run: false` (Evidence Trail append on cited principles is desired)

**Verdict handling:**

| Verdict | Action |
|---|---|
| `aligned` | No CLARIFICATION. `/ztn:check-decision` already appends `citation-aligned` to cited principles' Evidence Trail and bumps their `last_applied`. |
| `violated` with per-decision confidence ≥ 0.8 | Raise CLARIFICATION of type `principle-drift`. Include: quote from the record, the violated principle id, short "why this looks like drift" rationale, options to resolve (confirm deviation → refine principle; reconsider decision; mark exception). |
| `tradeoff` | Raise CLARIFICATION of type `principle-tradeoff` (info-level). Include: the two principles in tension, the direction the record chose, invitation to log explicit reasoning back into the record. |
| `no-match` | No CLARIFICATION. Not every decision touches the constitution. |

**CLARIFICATION item format** — same schema as other items under `## Open Items`:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — principle-drift: {principle.title}

**Type:** principle-drift
**Subject:** {principle.id}
**Source:** _records/{path}
**Action taken:** raised by /ztn:process Step 3.7.5 after /ztn:check-decision verdict violated (confidence 0.85)
**Quote:** > «{1–3 verbatim sentences from the record context}»
**Uncertainty:** Decision `{record.chosen}` appears to contradict `{principle.statement}`.
**To resolve:** confirm drift is intentional (refine principle or add exception note), reconsider the decision, or mark as a one-off exception with rationale.
```

`principle-tradeoff` uses the same shape with two principle refs in **Subject:**.

**Invariants for this sub-step:**

- Do not edit principle body. `/ztn:check-decision` handles L1 writes
  (Evidence Trail + `last_applied`); this step only raises CLARIFICATIONS.
- Do not create new principles. Pattern extraction into candidates is
  `/ztn:maintain`'s job, not `/ztn:process`.
- If `/ztn:check-decision` returns with an error (e.g. empty visible tree),
  log the failure in the processing record but do not block the batch —
  continue to Step 3.8. Constitution checking is additive, not a gate.

**Cost / latency note.** Each decision invokes `/ztn:check-decision`, which
runs Opus. On a Max subscription this is not a cost concern, but batches
with many decision records will add noticeable latency. If a batch starts
producing > 10 decision records per run, consider a single LLM call that
classifies the whole batch against the tree (one prompt, multi-record
reasoning) — that optimisation is not implemented today because current
batch sizes sit below that threshold and the per-record contract is
simpler to audit in `log_process.md`.

### 3.8 People Profiles

**This step APPLIES the canonical rules from `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` → "Data & Processing Rules".
Those rules are the single source of truth. If a rule changes, update SYSTEM_CONFIG, not this step.**

Applicable rules (all mandatory, no silent compromise):

1. **People inclusion — `inclusion-biased`.**
   - Every person with tier RESOLVED or NEW from the People Resolution Map (Step 0.2) who is mentioned in the transcript content (not noise) → include in the note's `people:` frontmatter array.
   - Do NOT apply "central to note" heuristic — it is subjective and a source of gaps.
   - **Bare first name** (AMBIGUOUS and cannot be resolved to a `firstname-lastname` ID) → do NOT add to `people:`. Default path: **append to `_system/state/people-candidates.jsonl`** via `python3 _system/scripts/append_person_candidate.py` (one entry per distinct mention — if the same bare name appears in N different transcripts in a batch, that's N appends). The buffer is aggregated weekly by `/ztn:lint` Scan C.5, which promotes recurring / information-rich candidates to CLARIFICATIONS. This keeps one-off mentions out of the user's resolution queue.

     **High-importance escape hatch.** Bypass the buffer and raise a CLARIFICATION immediately (the pre-2026-04-24 behaviour) ONLY when ANY of these signals are present:
     - Bare name belongs to an external/client meeting (transcript contains `meeting` + `external` markers, or the session is clearly a 1:1 with an outside party).
     - Full surname is present elsewhere in the same transcript but wasn't matched due to STT artifacts (you have enough info to resolve NOW).
     - Explicit user tagging `@resolve-now` in transcript or inbox override file.
     - Role + context are fully specified in a single mention (e.g. "новый Head of X", "CEO of {company}") — promoting later adds no info.

     In all other cases: buffer append, no CLARIFICATION, `clarifications_raised` counter NOT incremented for this mention (buffer appends are reported separately as `people_candidates_appended`).

     **Invocation:**
     ```bash
     python3 _system/scripts/append_person_candidate.py \
       --name "Антон" \
       --date {record.created} \
       --source {source-path-excerpt} \
       --note-id {produced-note-id} \
       --quote "{1–3 verbatim sentences around the mention}" \
       [--role-hint "{role inferred from context}"] \
       [--related-people id1,id2] \
       [--suggested-id {id if fuzzy-match suggests one}] \
       [--high-importance]  # only if escape-hatch triggered — but in that case ALSO raise a CLARIFICATION; the buffer line serves as audit trail
     ```

     Quote + role_hint + related_people are optional but strongly encouraged — they make weekly aggregation + promotion decisions deterministic (lint reads the buffer, never re-reads transcripts).

**CLARIFICATION item formatting requirement (person-identity / people-bare-name / people-identity).**

> Applies ONLY when the high-importance escape hatch (above) triggers. For routine one-off bare names — append to the candidates buffer instead; `/ztn:lint` Scan C.5 will emit the CLARIFICATION on aggregation if promotion rules fire.

The item body MUST include:

1. **`**Quote:**` field** — verbatim transcript fragment (≥1 full sentence, ideally 2–3) around the mention. User resolves без opening source transcript.
2. **`**Context:**` field** (mandatory) — 2–4 sentence paragraph self-contained для LLM review session. Includes: what ambiguity is about, why uncertain, related entities inline (wikilinks/ids), relevant Focus/People context, 1–2 candidate resolutions с brief pros/cons.

Also include nearby topic/project markers when they help disambiguate (often more useful than role heuristic alone).

**Distinction Quote vs Context:**
- `Quote` = verbatim fragment из транскрипта (deterministic, source-grounded)
- `Context` = LLM-synthesized surrounding understanding (what item is *about*, not what was said verbatim)

Template:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — «{name-as-transcribed}» в T{N} ({timestamp}) — {one-line hint}

**Type:** people-bare-name | person-identity
**Subject:** {bare-name string OR candidate person-id}
**Source:** _sources/processed/{path}
**Suggested action:** resolve-bare-name | create-profile | dismiss
**Confidence tier:** surfaced (process always surfaces — never auto-applies identity)
**Action taken:** {what the pipeline did}

**Quote:** > «{1–3 verbatim sentences around the mention from the transcript}»

**Context:** {2–4 sentence paragraph: what ambiguity is about, PEOPLE.md candidates if any, related hub/project context, 1–2 candidate resolutions с brief rationale}

**Uncertainty:** {what is unclear and why}
**To resolve:** {what the user needs to do}
```

2. **Mention counting — `1-per-file`.**
   - When a person first appears in this file (in `people:` frontmatter OR as subject of the record/note), `Mentions` in PEOPLE.md += **1**.
   - Repeated occurrences of the SAME person within the SAME file do NOT increment further. Monotonic.
   - Decrements only happen on manual deletion or `/ztn:lint` dedup (out of scope here).

3. **PEOPLE.md 8-column schema preservation.**
   - Any write to PEOPLE.md (insert OR update) preserves all 8 columns: `ID | Name | Role | Org | Profile | Tier | Mentions | Last`.
   - On update of an existing row: change only the columns that changed (typically `Mentions`, `Last`, sometimes `Role`/`Org`). Never drop or reorder columns.

4. **Tier assignment — only on insert of a NEW person.**
   - If a profile was created in `3_resources/people/{id}.md` during this step → `Tier = 1`.
   - Otherwise → `Tier = 3` (default for newly added entries without profile).
   - **Existing persons are NEVER re-tiered by this skill.** Tier promotion (3 → 2, 2 → 1) is `/ztn:maintain` responsibility. Demotion requires human-in-the-loop via CLARIFICATION (never automatic).

For each person mentioned in the transcript (using the People Resolution Map):

1. **If exists in PEOPLE.md:**
   a) **New context check** — does the transcript reveal any of:
      - New role, title, or responsibility?
      - Organizational change (team move, promotion, new project)?
      - New relationship context with the author or other people?
      - Expressed opinion, skill, or competency not previously captured?
      - Key quote or characterization?
   b) If yes to ANY: READ current profile (`3_resources/people/{id}.md`)
      → APPEND new information to `## Контекст` section (don't overwrite existing text)
      → Update `## Ключевые темы` if new topic areas emerged
   c) **ALWAYS** add backlink to `## Упоминания`:
      `- [[{note-id}|{brief context}]] — YYYY-MM-DD`
      This is NOT optional — every mention in every processed transcript gets a backlink.
   d) Update row in PEOPLE.md:
      - `Mentions` += 1 (increment; dedup rule: 1 per file per person, не per-utterance)
      - `Last` = note's `created` date (YYYY-MM-DD)
      - `Tier` — не пересчитывать здесь (это задача `/ztn:maintain`). Оставить текущее значение

2. **If NEW (from People Resolution Map or discovered during audit):**
   - Create profile in `3_resources/people/{id}.md` using
     `{{MINDER_ZTN_BASE}}/5_meta/templates/person-template.md`
   - **Privacy trio (mandatory).** Set in profile frontmatter:
     - `origin` — inherit from the **creating record's `origin`** (the
       record that first surfaced this person in the current batch).
       Work-meeting record → `work`; personal-reflection record →
       `personal`; external-source record → `external`. If multiple
       records mention the new person in the same batch, use the
       chronologically-first record's `origin`. NEVER hardcode
       `personal` — it biases work-roster profiles wrongly.
     - `audience_tags` — ALWAYS `[]`. Profile aggregates owner-side
       context (mentions, opinions) which must not be re-shared
       without explicit owner widening — even for public colleagues.
     - `is_sensitive` — `true` if any captured content about this
       person is health / legal / personal-risk; `false` otherwise.
   - Add row to `3_resources/people/PEOPLE.md`. Все 8 колонок обязательны:
     - `ID`, `Name`, `Role`, `Org` — из extracted context
     - `Profile` — `[[{id}]]` (wikilink)
     - `Tier` — `1` если профиль создан (auto-Tier-1 правило SDD); иначе `3`
     - `Mentions` — `1`
     - `Last` — note's `created` date
   - Add `person/{id}` tag to `_system/registries/TAGS.md`
   - Add person to the People Resolution Map (for subsequent files)

3. **If identity uncertain:**
   - Make best guess and create the profile (inclusion-biased)
   - Log uncertainty in `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` **Open Items** section
     with enough context for the user to resolve quickly
   - When user resolves: move item from Open Items to **Resolved Archive** table
     (one-line summary: date, item, resolution). This keeps Open Items clean
     while preserving audit trail for future transcription artifact matching.

Within a batch: if the same new person appears in multiple transcripts,
consolidate information BEFORE creating the profile. Collect all mentions
first, then create one comprehensive profile.

### 3.9 System Updates

**Runs in orchestrator, post-aggregate.** Subagents do NOT touch
PROCESSED.md or log_process.md — those updates are batched here from
aggregated subagent manifests.

For each processed source path (collected from all subagent manifests):

1. **PROCESSED.md** — add entry to the existing table (header: `| Source | Main Note | Date |`):
   `| _sources/processed/{source}/{timestamp}/transcript*.md | zettelkasten/{path-to-main-note}.md | YYYY-MM-DD |`
   Source path points to the FINAL location in `processed/` (file was moved there in Step 2.4).
   Duplicate check: if source path already in table, skip (unless `--reprocess`).

2. **log_process.md** — add one entry per run at TOP (newest first), aggregating across all batches:

   ```markdown
   ## YYYY-MM-DD — Processing: {run-summary}

   **Sources:** {N total, list grouped by batch}
   **Records created:** {N} — {list of record IDs}
   **Knowledge notes created:** {N} — {list of note IDs}
   **Knowledge notes extracted:** {N} — {list, with "from {record-id}"}
   **Hubs updated:** {N} — {list of hub IDs with brief change description}
   **Hubs created:** {N} — {list of new hub IDs}
   **People created:** {N} — {list}
   **People updated:** {N} — {list}
   **Self-review fixes:** {N total} — {distribution by type: MISSED / DISTORTED / HALLUCINATED / THIN DECISION / UNLINKED REVISION}
   **Concepts upserted:** {N} — total distinct concept identities touched this run
   **Concept type-conflicts:** {N} — same concept name carried different `type` across mentions; first-chronological wins (autofix, no CLARIFICATION)
   **Concept translations dropped:** {N} — non-English source terms with no clean translation; dropped to keep graph identity stable
   **Sensitive entities:** {N} — entities emitted with `is_sensitive: true`
   **Batches:** {batch_count} — {token totals, transcript counts per batch}
   ```

(Context handoff between transcripts now happens implicitly within shared
subagent context per batch; no per-file handoff document needed.)

### 3.10 Verify Source Integrity

**Runs in orchestrator, post-aggregate.** Cross-cuts the file completeness
invariant from §3.0.4 with note-level path checks.

For every source path in `S` (enumerated set from §3.0.4):
- Confirm file exists in `_sources/processed/{source}/{id}/` (moved in Step 2.4).
- Confirm at least one note in subagent manifests carries this path in its
  `source:` field (or in any `source:` of its produced notes).
- Confirm PROCESSED.md entry was written for it (Step 3.9).

If any check fails — halt at Completion Gate (Step 5). Do NOT proceed to
batch artifacts. The mismatch implies either a subagent silently dropped
a transcript or a write-step failed; both require investigation, not
continuation.

---

## Step 4: Post-Processing

After ALL files in the batch are processed:

### 4.1 Update TASKS.md

**Canonical structure & format: see `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` → "Task Format" section.**
Source of truth for section names, classification rules, header format, and stream grouping.

**Regeneration algorithm:**

1. **Read existing TASKS.md first** — extract the set of `^task-id` values currently
   in the `## Stale` section. These IDs MUST be preserved in Stale, never moved back
   to active sections, even if the source note still has them as `- [ ]`.
   Stale = result of user's manual review; pipeline doesn't override it.

2. **Scan ALL notes** (records + knowledge) for `- [ ]` items. Extract task description,
   linked note, `^task-id`, and any `→ [[person-id]]` reference.

3. **Classify each task** using the table in SYSTEM_CONFIG (Action / Waiting / Delegate).
   Key distinctions:
   - **Action**: «{owner-first-name from SOUL.md Identity}: ...», first-person speech (`I:`/`я:`), or task clearly for owner to execute
   - **Waiting**: «@person: ...» AND owner is the recipient of the output (blocker for owner)
   - **Delegate**: owner assigned/escalated, owns tracking, but output goes to team/process
   - **Someday** / **Personal**: separate sections (low priority; non-work)
   - **Unclear**: → Action (safe default)

4. **Apply Stale preservation** — any task whose `^task-id` was in old Stale section →
   new Stale section. All other tasks → appropriate active section.

5. **Group within each section by stream** (`### Stream Name`). Use existing streams
   from the current TASKS.md; create new stream when a clear topic cluster emerges
   (≥3 related tasks). Stream list is organic and evolves.

6. **Semantic dedup** — if two tasks express the same work from different notes,
   merge into one entry with both `[[note-link]]` references and a single `^task-id`
   (keep the more descriptive ID). Log merges in the report.

7. **Update header** — recompute `Last Updated`, per-section counts, `Total unique`.

NOTE: At 500+ notes, switch to incremental update (scan only new/modified notes,
merge into existing TASKS.md structure). For now, regenerate from all notes
while preserving Stale.

### 4.2 Update CALENDAR.md

**Canonical structure & format: see `_system/docs/SYSTEM_CONFIG.md` → "Event/Meeting Format" section.**

Scan ALL notes for dated events (`📅` items) and future meetings.

**Regeneration algorithm:**
1. Extract all `📅 **YYYY-MM-DD**` items with descriptions and note links.
2. Separate Recurring (explicit regular meetings in note content) from one-off events.
3. Identify Deadlines — events framed as «@person должен сделать X к дате» — move to Deadlines section.
4. Split one-off events by date vs today:
   - Future → Upcoming
   - Past but within 2 weeks → Past
   - Older than 2 weeks → DROP (don't carry forward)
5. Update `Last Updated` in header.

### 4.3 Update HUB_INDEX.md

Rebuild the hub index table from all hub files in `5_meta/mocs/`.

### 4.4 Content Potential Verification

Verify that all newly created knowledge notes with content potential have
complete frontmatter: `content_potential`, `content_type`, and `content_angle`.
If any field is missing — add it now based on Q14 assessment.

NOTE: There is no separate CONTENT_PIPELINE registry. Content candidates live
in note frontmatter and are discovered dynamically by `/ztn:check-content`.
POSTS.md tracks only published posts.

### 4.5 Batch Verification

Run these checks over the ENTIRE processing run's output:

- [ ] Count match: every transcript-grounded source produced exactly one record (kind = meeting | observation per Q9 routing)
- [ ] No orphan path-link Evidence Trails: every new knowledge note's `## Evidence Trail` wikilink points at a record-id or note-id, never at `_sources/...`
- [ ] No orphan extracted_from: every `extracted_from:` reference points to an existing record
- [ ] All hubs exist: every hub referenced in notes exists as a file in `5_meta/mocs/`
- [ ] Bidirectional cross-references: if note A links to note B, note B's hub/relations should reference note A
- [ ] No duplicate notes: no two notes cover the same topic from the same source
- [ ] PROCESSED.md complete: every processed source file has an entry
- [ ] People registry consistent: every person ID in any note's frontmatter exists in PEOPLE.md
- [ ] Concept aggregation: every distinct concept name appearing in any frontmatter `concepts:` field across the run has exactly one entry in `concepts.upserts[]` (deduplication by case-folded snake_case). When the same name was emitted with different `type` values across mentions, the **first-chronological-mention wins** (deterministic by transcript timestamp); subsequent mentions silently coerce to that type for the upsert. No CLARIFICATION raised — autonomous tie-break.
- [ ] Hub `member_concepts[]` consistency: for every hub touched, manifest `member_concepts[]` equals the union of `concepts:` from member knowledge notes that exist on disk after this run. No phantom concept names (in member_concepts but in no member note's frontmatter).

### 4.6 Content Proportionality Check + Coverage Fix Rate

#### Proportionality

Compare source length vs output density:

| Source type | Expected key points per ~10 minutes |
|---|---|
| Work meeting (tactical) | 5-8 bullets |
| Work meeting (strategic) | 3-5 bullets + 1-2 knowledge notes |
| Therapy / reflection | 2-4 knowledge notes |
| Idea brainstorm | 1-3 knowledge notes |

If output is significantly thinner than expected, flag in the report.

#### Coverage Fix Rate

Aggregate `fixes_applied` from all subagent manifests. Calculate: what %
of notes had any fix during §3.7 self-review?

- < 20%: Normal. Producer pass and self-review well-aligned.
- 20-50%: Elevated. Subagent's main pass leaving gaps the self-review is
  catching — review classification prompt or context budget per batch.
- > 50%: Systemic issue. Flag in report with recommendation (likely
  T threshold too high or N cap too high — subagent attention diluted).

Also report: distribution of fix types (MISSED / DISTORTED / HALLUCINATED /
THIN DECISION / UNLINKED REVISION) — concentration in one type points to
a specific failure mode in the pipeline.

### 4.7 Batch Data Accumulation (in-memory, before Completion Gate)

Assemble the full dataset required for the batch artifacts — **in memory only**, no disk
writes yet. Disk writes happen at Step 5.5, strictly after the Completion Gate.

Accumulate:

- **`batch_id`** = UTC timestamp of run start, format `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss`. Fixed at the moment the concurrency lock was acquired and stable for the rest of the run. On collision (theoretical, due to concurrency lock this should not happen) — append suffix `-1`, `-2`.
- **`timestamp`** = ISO 8601 UTC with trailing `Z` (run start).
- **`processor`** = `ztn:process`.
- **`batch_format_version`** = per `_system/docs/batch-format.md` current spec version (currently `2.0`).
- **Counts:** `sources`, `records`, `notes`, `tasks`, `events`, `threads_opened = 0`, `threads_resolved = 0`, `clarifications_raised`, `people_candidates_appended`, `concepts_upserted`, `sensitive_entities`, `concept_type_conflicts`, `concept_translations_dropped` (see counter mechanics below).
- **Lists for each section of the batch report:** Sources Processed (with source type ID), Records Created (id + title + people + projects), Knowledge Notes Created (id + title + types + domains + Evidence Trail status), Tasks Extracted (task-id + description + deadline + priority + from-note), Events Extracted (datetime + description + participants + from-note), People Updates (id + change type + mentions delta + tier note), Hubs Updated (id list), CLARIFICATIONS Raised (type + summary per item), Concepts Upserted (name + type + subtype + related_concepts), Sensitive Entities (path + kind + audience_tags).

**Observability counters (engine self-watch — no owner action).**

- `concept_type_conflicts` — increment when the same canonical concept
  name appears in this batch with two or more different `type` values
  across mentions. The first-chronological-mention wins (§4.7 below);
  subsequent mentions silently coerce. The counter exists so a sustained
  non-zero trend over weeks can be eyeballed in `BATCH_LOG.md` and
  prompts a pipeline review — no per-batch CLARIFICATION.
- `concept_translations_dropped` — increment for every concept candidate
  Q15 dropped because the source term was genuinely untranslatable.
  Same rationale: per-event invisible to owner; aggregate over time
  surfaces a translation-quality regression worth investigating.

Both counters land in two places:
- per-batch frontmatter at `_system/state/batches/{batch_id}.md` (one
  row per batch — high-fidelity)
- per-run summary at `_system/state/log_process.md` (one entry per
  /ztn:process invocation — easy-to-eyeball aggregate)

They are NOT added to BATCH_LOG.md (which is a 9-column terse routing
index for lint scanning, not an observability surface — adding columns
bloats it without corresponding usage). They are observability slots,
never gating signals.

**Concept registry aggregation.** Build `concepts.upserts[]` for
the batch:

1. Walk every record + knowledge note + hub touched in this run; collect
   their `concepts:` frontmatter values (plus, for hubs, the union of
   member-note `concepts:` → `member_concepts[]`).
2. Run every collected name through `normalize_concept_name()`. Drop
   `None` returns silently. Deduplicate the surviving list by canonical
   name (case-folded snake_case). For each distinct name, consolidate
   metadata captured during Q15 extraction:
   - `type` — first-chronological-mention wins (deterministic by
     transcript timestamp). If `qdrant` was tagged `tool` in transcript
     T1 and `theme` in T2, the upsert carries `type: tool`. Subsequent
     mentions silently coerce.
   - `subtype` — same first-wins rule.
   - `related_concepts[]` — set-union of all related lists across
     mentions, each entry passed through `normalize_concept_name()` and
     filtered to exclude the parent `name` (no self-loops).
   - `previous_slugs[]` — present only if a Q15 rename was detected;
     each entry passed through normaliser; otherwise omitted.
3. **Autonomous post-normalisation guard.** Every value emitted into
   `concepts.upserts[]` was already produced by `normalize_concept_name()`
   in step 2 — by construction it is conformant. No additional halt,
   no CLARIFICATION. Lint Scan A.7 is a post-write double-check that
   stays silent on a clean batch.
4. Final list = `concepts.upserts[]`. `concepts_upserted` counter =
   `len(concepts.upserts)`.

**Sensitive-entity aggregation.** Walk every entity emitted in
this run (records, knowledge notes, hubs touched, person profiles
created/updated, project profiles, tasks, events, ideas). For each
where `is_sensitive: true`, append `{path, kind, audience_tags}` to
`sensitive_entities[]`. `sensitive_entities` counter = `len(...)`.

**Per-entity privacy field aggregation.** Every entity entry in the
in-memory accumulator carries the trio (`origin`, `audience_tags`,
`is_sensitive`) read directly from the entity's frontmatter. The
manifest emission step (5.5) writes these into the JSON manifest's
per-entity sections so downstream Minder can populate `audience_tags
text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` columns without re-parsing markdown.

**`clarifications_raised` counter mechanics:**

- The skill maintains an in-memory integer counter across the entire run. Reset to **0** at run start.
- Every time the skill appends an item under `## Open Items` in `_system/state/CLARIFICATIONS.md` — regardless of type (`process-compatibility`, `people-bare-name`, `people-identity`, `idea-ambiguous-match`, `evidence-trail-anomaly`, etc.) — the counter increments by exactly **1**.
- The final counter value is recorded in batch frontmatter as `clarifications_raised:`.
- The counter is **not** persisted between runs.

**`people_candidates_appended` counter mechanics:**

- Parallel in-memory counter reset to **0** at run start.
- Increments by 1 for every successful `append_person_candidate.py` invocation (one per bare-name mention routed to the buffer).
- Does NOT double-count high-importance escape-hatch cases: in that path, a CLARIFICATION is raised (increments `clarifications_raised`) AND a buffer line is written as audit trail (increments `people_candidates_appended`). Both counters are independent.
- The final value is recorded in batch frontmatter as `people_candidates_appended:`.
- Report it separately from `clarifications_raised` in the batch report — these are two distinct user-visible states (inbox for lint aggregation vs immediate resolution queue).

**Thread counts are zero.** `/ztn:process` does NOT open or resolve threads — that is `/ztn:maintain` responsibility. This is a hard invariant and is checked at the Completion Gate.

---

## Step 5: Completion Gate

**MANDATORY. Do NOT produce the report until ALL items are verified.**

If any item is incomplete, go back and complete it. No deferring as "follow-up."

- [ ] All transcripts processed (records + knowledge notes written to disk)
- [ ] **File completeness invariant** (§3.0.4): union of `transcripts_processed[].path` across all subagent manifests equals enumerated source set `S` exactly — no missing, no duplicates
- [ ] Self-review (Step 3.7) coverage manifest returned for EVERY transcript; `fixes_applied` populated (empty list explicit if no fixes)
- [ ] No subagent returned a non-empty `errors` list (halt-on-error invariant)
- [ ] Per-note structural verification passed (Step 3.6, inside subagent)
- [ ] People profiles: new people added to PEOPLE.md + profile files created in `3_resources/people/`
- [ ] People profiles: existing people's `## Упоминания` updated with new mentions
- [ ] Tags: new `person/{id}` tags added to TAGS.md for new people
- [ ] Hubs: existing hubs updated (rewrite "Текущее понимание", add to chronological map, changelog)
- [ ] Hubs: new hubs CREATED for topics reaching 3+ knowledge notes threshold
- [ ] HUB_INDEX.md rebuilt
- [ ] PROCESSED.md updated for all processed source paths
- [ ] log_process.md entry added (newest first)
- [ ] TASKS.md updated (header counts refreshed; Stale section preserved from previous TASKS.md; classification Action/Waiting/Delegate applied per SYSTEM_CONFIG rules)
- [ ] CALENDAR.md updated (Past section pruned to last 2 weeks; Deadlines have `@person-id` prefix)
- [ ] Content potential fields verified (content_potential + content_type + content_angle)
- [ ] Knowledge notes placed in correct PARA folder (NOT in deprecated `2_areas/work/meetings/`)
- [ ] New records in `_records/{meetings,observations}/` per Q9 routing (NOT in `2_areas/work/meetings/`); every transcript anchored to exactly one record
- [ ] Batch verification passed (Step 4.5)
- [ ] CLARIFICATIONS.md reviewed — new items noted for report
- [ ] content_potential assessed for all new knowledge notes (Q14)
- [ ] Every new knowledge note (`layer: knowledge`, not record, not profile) in this batch contains `## Evidence Trail` with ≥ 1 initial entry placed BEFORE `## Source`
- [ ] PEOPLE.md — 8 columns (`ID | Name | Role | Org | Profile | Tier | Mentions | Last`) preserved in every row touched this run; new rows have all 8 populated
- [ ] In-memory batch data accumulated (Step 4.7): `batch_id` fixed; count fields reconcile with actually created artifacts; `clarifications_raised` matches the in-memory counter value
- [ ] `threads_opened = 0` AND `threads_resolved = 0` (process does not touch threads)
- [ ] `people_candidates_appended` matches both (a) the in-memory counter and (b) actual line-count delta in `_system/state/people-candidates.jsonl` since run start. If mismatch — do NOT write batch; investigate the gap (typically missed append invocation or double-count on escape-hatch path)
- [ ] **Concept extraction (Q15) ran for every transcript.** Every produced record + knowledge note carries a `concepts:` frontmatter field (list, possibly `[]`). Every non-empty entry is the output of `normalize_concept_name()` (post-normalisation values are conformant by construction).
- [ ] **Privacy trio (Q16) set on every emitted entity.** Every record, knowledge note, hub touched, person profile created/updated, project profile, task, event, idea has all three fields (`origin`, `audience_tags`, `is_sensitive`) present in frontmatter. Defaults applied silently where Q16 didn't infer.
- [ ] **`concepts.upserts[]` aggregation passed (§4.7).** Every entry produced by `normalize_concept_name()` chain; first-chronological-mention wins for `type` ties. `concepts_upserted` counter matches `len(concepts.upserts)`.
- [ ] **`sensitive_entities[]` aggregation passed (§4.7).** Every entity with `is_sensitive: true` listed once in `sensitive_entities[]` with `{path, kind, audience_tags}`. `sensitive_entities` counter matches `len(...)`.
- [ ] **Hub privacy auto-derivation passed.** Every hub touched in this run had `origin` / `audience_tags` / `is_sensitive` re-derived from current members (dominant origin / audience-intersection / any-sensitive) before manifest emission.

**Note on batch artifacts:** the files `_system/state/batches/{batch-id}.md` and the new row in
`_system/state/BATCH_LOG.md` are NOT yet on disk at this point, and therefore are NOT checked in
this gate. Their write happens at Step 5.5 — strictly POST-Gate. If this gate fails, Step 5.5
does not run and no batch file appears on disk. Absence of batch = absence of contract.
Crash recovery via PROCESSED.md handles partial filesystem state on the next run.

**No deferring.** Every item above is part of the pipeline, not follow-up.
If context window is tight, use subagents for parallel work
(hub creation, view regeneration) — but verify their output.

---

## Step 5.5: Batch Artifacts Write (post-Gate)

**Runs ONLY if Step 5 Completion Gate passed fully.** If the gate failed, stop here —
no batch artifacts on disk.

### 5.5.1 Write `_system/state/batches/{batch-id}.md`

Create the per-batch report file according to the contract in
`_system/docs/batch-format.md`.

**Frontmatter (all keys required):**

```yaml
---
batch_id: {YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}
timestamp: {ISO 8601 UTC with trailing Z}
processor: ztn:process
batch_format_version: {current spec version from batch-format.md}
sources: N
records: N
notes: N
tasks: N
events: N
threads_opened: 0
threads_resolved: 0
clarifications_raised: N
people_candidates_appended: N
concepts_upserted: N
sensitive_entities: N
concept_type_conflicts: N
concept_translations_dropped: N
---
```

**Sections (in this exact order, never skipped — use `(none)` when empty):**

1. `## Sources Processed` — one bullet per transcript: `- {path} ({source-type-id})`
2. `## Records Created` — per record: `- [[{id}]] | {title}` + child bullets `People:` and `Projects:`
3. `## Knowledge Notes Created` — per note: `- [[{id}]] | {title}` + child bullets `Types:` + `Domains:` + `Evidence Trail: started|appended`
4. `## Tasks Extracted` — per task: `- {task-id} | {description} | deadline: {date or —} | priority: {low|normal|high}` + child bullet `From: [[{note-id}]]`
5. `## Events Extracted` — per event: `- {datetime} | {description} | participants: {ids}` + child bullet `From: [[{note-id}]]`
6. `## People Updates` — per person touched: `- {id} | {change-type} | mentions: {before}→{after} | tier: {value} (no change | promoted via maintain later)`
7. `## Threads` with sub-sections `### Opened` and `### Resolved` — both `(none)` for `/ztn:process` (process never touches threads)
8. `## Hubs Updated` — `- [[{hub-id}]]` per hub touched
9. `## CLARIFICATIONS Raised` — per item: `- {type} | {one-line summary}` — count MUST equal `clarifications_raised` in frontmatter
10. `## People Candidates Appended` — per entry: `- {candidate_id} | {name_as_transcribed} | {note-id} | {role_hint or —}` — count MUST equal `people_candidates_appended` in frontmatter. Use `(none)` if empty.
11. `## Concepts Upserted` — per concept upsert from §4.7 aggregation: `- {name} | {type} | {subtype or —} | {related_concepts comma-list or —}` — count MUST equal `concepts_upserted` in frontmatter. Use `(none)` if empty. Mirrors the JSON manifest's `concepts.upserts[]`.
12. `## Sensitive Entities` — per entity emitted in this run with `is_sensitive: true`: `- {path-or-id} | {kind: record|note|hub|task|...} | audience_tags: [{tags or "[]"}]` — count MUST equal `sensitive_entities` in frontmatter. Use `(none)` if empty.

### 5.5.1.5 Write `_system/state/batches/{batch-id}.json`

Emit the machine-parseable JSON manifest alongside the markdown
report. Schema: `minder-project/strategy/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.5
(downstream consumer = Minder dispatch worker).

Assemble the JSON dict in memory from the in-memory accumulator
(§4.7) — top-level keys per ARCHITECTURE.md §4.5 (`batch_id`,
`timestamp`, `format_version: "2.0"`, `processor: "ztn:process"`,
`sources_processed[]`, `records.{created,updated}[]`,
`knowledge_notes.{created,updated}[]`, `hubs.{created,updated}[]`,
`constitution{}`, `tier1_objects{}`, `tier2_objects{}`,
`concepts.upserts[]`, `stats{}`). Each per-entity entry carries
`origin`, `audience_tags`, `is_sensitive` from frontmatter; concept
fields per the same accumulator output.

Then invoke the autonomous emitter:

```bash
python3 _system/scripts/emit_batch_manifest.py \
    --input <path-to-temp-json> \
    --output _system/state/batches/{batch_id}.json
```

The helper:
- runs every concept name through `normalize_concept_name()` (post-
  emission safety net; clean accumulator → zero events)
- enforces audience-tag whitelist via canonical 5 + AUDIENCES.md
  active extensions
- coerces `origin` / `is_sensitive` to safe defaults if invalid
- drops `concepts.upserts[]` entries whose `name` is unnormalisable
- writes the conformant JSON; emits any normalisation events on
  stderr for ingestion into the batch's audit log

Failure semantics:
- exit `0` — manifest written
- exit `2` — input is not parseable JSON or root is not an object
- exit `3` — manifest fails the structural contract with downstream
  Minder (missing required top-level key, unknown `processor`,
  incompatible `format_version` major, or processor-required section
  missing). Field-level concept / audience normalisation NEVER
  produces non-zero exit — autofix or drop per the autonomous-
  pipeline contract.

If exit `3` fires: the in-memory accumulator is malformed (missing
section the SKILL forgot to populate, or wrong processor enum). Do
NOT retry blindly — read stderr message, fix the accumulator
assembly, re-emit. Surface to owner as a `process-compatibility`
CLARIFICATION ONLY if root cause cannot be auto-corrected (e.g.
ARCHITECTURE.md spec changed and SKILL contract drifted).

### 5.5.2 Append row to `_system/state/BATCH_LOG.md`

Append ONE new markdown table row to the Batch Log, matching the schema defined
in `_system/docs/batch-format.md` (9 columns):

```
| {batch_id} | {timestamp} | {sources} | {records} | {notes} | {tasks} | {events} | 0 | 0 |
```

**Strict rules:**
- Append-only. Never rewrite, reorder, or delete existing rows.
- Exactly ONE new row per successful run.
- The `threads_open` and `threads_close` columns are always `0` for `/ztn:process` output.

### 5.5.3 Failure semantics

The three artifacts of Step 5.5 (markdown, JSON manifest, BATCH_LOG row)
are atomic-ish: BATCH_LOG row appends only after BOTH `batches/{id}.md`
AND `batches/{id}.json` wrote successfully.

- If markdown write fails (filesystem error) → best-effort delete the
  partial file; do NOT proceed to JSON write or BATCH_LOG append.
- If JSON write fails (filesystem error, OR `emit_batch_manifest.py`
  exit 3 = structural contract violation) → best-effort delete the
  partial JSON; KEEP the markdown file (it remains a valid
  human-readable record of the run); do NOT append BATCH_LOG row.
  Markdown without JSON is observable as «row missing in BATCH_LOG»
  on next lint scan — surfaces the gap explicitly.
- On any 5.5 failure: log the error, surface it in the Step 6 report
  under `### Errors`, exit non-zero. Crash recovery via PROCESSED.md
  handles the next-run picture; this run's notes are already on disk
  (Step 3.5 wrote them inside subagents) and will not be re-processed
  unless `--reprocess` is passed.

---
